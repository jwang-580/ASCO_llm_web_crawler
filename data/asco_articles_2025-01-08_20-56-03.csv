The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned coprimary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical trial updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

Long-term outcomes from Children's Oncology Group study AEWS0031 were assessed to determine whether the survival advantage of interval-compressed chemotherapy (ICC) was maintained over 10 years in patients with localized Ewing sarcoma (ES). AEWS0031 enrolled 568 eligible patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide-etoposide alternating once every 3 weeks (standard timing chemotherapy [STC]) versus once every 2 weeks (ICC). For this updated report, one patient was excluded because of uncertainty of original diagnosis. The 10-year event-free survival (EFS) was 70% with ICC compared with 61% with STC (P = .03), and 10-year overall survival (OS) was 76% with ICC compared with 69% with STC (P = .04). There was no difference in the 10-year cumulative incidence of second malignant neoplasms (SMNs; PC [see Data Supplement, online only] = .5). A test for interaction demonstrated that ICC provided greater risk reduction for patients with tumor volume ≥200 mL than for patients with tumors <200 mL, but no evidence for a significant interaction in other subgroups defined by age, primary site, and histologic response. With longer-term follow-up, ICC for localized ES is associated with superior EFS and OS without an increased risk for SMN compared with STC. ICC is associated with improved outcomes even in adverse-risk patient groups.",2023-10-20,JCO.23.00053,"[{'Author': 'Thomas Cash', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: EUSA Pharma', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Y-mAbs Therapeutics', 'Research Funding: Celgene (Inst), Roche/Genentech (Inst), Lilly (Inst)', 'Uncompensated Relationships: United Therapeutics, Lilly']}, {'Author': 'Mark D.

Therefore, we conducted a phase III clinical study to verify the efficacy and safety of this combination regimen in patients with K-Ras wild-type tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02395016).

Patients and Methods: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive nimotuzumab (400 mg once per week) or placebo followed by gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15, once every 4 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) and the secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), response rates, and safety.

Results: A total of 480 patients were screened; 92 patients were enrolled and 82 patients with K-Ras wild-type tumors were eligible. In the full analysis set, the median OS was 10.9 versus 8.5 months, while the restricted mean survival time (RMST) was 18.05 versus 11.14 months for the investigational versus control arm (ratio of control v investigation = 0.62 [0.40-0.97]; P = .036). Median PFS was 4.2 versus 3.6 months in the investigational versus control arm (log-rank P = .04; hazard ratio, 0.60 [0.37-0.99]) and the restricted mean PFS time was 8.08 versus 4.76 months (RMST ratio, 0.58 [0.38-0.90]; P = .036). Both OS and PFS were longer in the nimotuzumab group than in the placebo group. The objective response rates and disease control rates were 7% versus 10% and 68% versus 63% for the investigational and control groups, respectively. The incidence of adverse events were comparable between the two groups.

Hartenbach; Rebecca  Baergen,TX).; TX).; TX).; TX).; TX).; TX).; TX).; TX).; TX).; TX).,"Purpose: In randomized trials the combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel was superior to cisplatin and cyclophosphamide in advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer. Although in nonrandomized trials, carboplatin and paclitaxel was a less toxic and highly active combination regimen, there remained concern regarding its efficacy in patients with small-volume, resected, stage III disease. Thus, we conducted a noninferiority trial of cisplatin and paclitaxel versus carboplatin and paclitaxel in this population.

Patients and Methods: Patients with advanced ovarian cancer and no residual mass greater than 1.0 cm after surgery were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin 75 mg/m2 plus a 24-hour infusion of paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 (arm I), or carboplatin area under the curve 7.5 intravenously plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours (arm II).

Results: Seven hundred ninety-two eligible patients were enrolled onto the study. Prognostic factors were similar in the two treatment groups. Gastrointestinal, renal, and metabolic toxicity, as well as grade 4 leukopenia, were significantly more frequent in arm I. Grade 2 or greater thrombocytopenia was more common in arm II. Neurologic toxicity was similar in both regimens. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 19.4 and 48.7 months, respectively, for arm I compared with 20.7 and 57.4 months, respectively, for arm II. The relative risk (RR) of progression for the carboplatin plus paclitaxel group was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 1.03) and the RR of death was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.02).

Conclusion: In patients with advanced ovarian cancer, a chemotherapy regimen consisting of carboplatin plus paclitaxel results in less toxicity, is easier to administer, and is not inferior, when compared with cisplatin plus paclitaxel.",2023-9-1,JCO.22.02766,[]

Immunotherapy may be synergistic with bevacizumab and chemotherapy.

Patients and Methods: ATALANTE/ENGOT-ov29 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02891824), a placebo-controlled double-blinded randomized phase III trial, enrolled patients with recurrent epithelial OC, one to two previous chemotherapy lines, and PFI >6 months. Eligible patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to atezolizumab (1,200 mg once every 3 weeks or equivalent) or placebo for up to 24 months, combined with bevacizumab and six cycles of chemotherapy doublet, stratified by PFI, PD-L1 status, and chemotherapy regimen. Coprimary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and PD-L1–positive populations (alpha .025 for each population).

Results: Between September 2016 and October 2019, 614 patients were randomly assigned: 410 to atezolizumab and 204 to placebo. Only 38% had PD-L1–positive tumors. After 3 years' median follow-up, the PFS difference between atezolizumab and placebo did not reach statistical significance in the ITT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99; P = .041; median 13.5 v 11.3 months, respectively) or PD-L1–positive (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.16; P = .30; median 15.2 v 13.1 months, respectively) populations. The immature overall survival (OS) HR was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.01; median 35.5 v 30.6 months with atezolizumab v placebo, respectively). Global health-related quality of life did not differ between treatment arms. Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 88% of atezolizumab-treated and 87% of placebo-treated patients; grade ≥3 AEs typical of immunotherapy were more common with atezolizumab (13% v 8%, respectively).

Conclusion: ATALANTE/ENGOT-ov29 did not meet its coprimary PFS objectives in the ITT or PD-L1–positive populations. OS follow-up continues.

Cohen; the Investigators involved in the high-grade glioma cohort,United Kingdom; Japan; Japan; Germany; TN; Germany; Germany; Germany; Canada; DC; Germany; Switzerland; Switzerland; NJ; MD,"Purpose: BRAF V600 mutation is detected in 5%-10% of pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs), and effective treatments are limited. In previous trials, dabrafenib as monotherapy or in combination with trametinib demonstrated activity in children and adults with relapsed/refractory BRAF V600–mutant HGG.

Methods: This phase II study evaluated dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with relapsed/refractory BRAF V600–mutant pHGG. The primary objective was overall response rate (ORR) by independent review by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. Secondary objectives included ORR by investigator determination, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), and safety.

Results: A total of 41 pediatric patients with previously treated BRAF V600–mutant HGG were enrolled. At primary analysis, median follow-up was 25.1 months, and 51% of patients remained on treatment. Sixteen of 20 discontinuations were due to progressive disease in this relapsed/refractory pHGG population. Independently assessed ORR was 56% (95% CI, 40 to 72). Median DOR was 22.2 months (95% CI, 7.6 months to not reached [NR]). Fourteen deaths were reported. Median OS was 32.8 months (95% CI, 19.2 months to NR). The most common all-cause adverse events (AEs) were pyrexia (51%), headache (34%), and dry skin (32%). Two patients (5%) had AEs (both rash) leading to discontinuation.

Conclusion: In relapsed/refractory BRAF V600–mutant pHGG, dabrafenib plus trametinib improved ORR versus previous trials of chemotherapy in molecularly unselected patients with pHGG and was associated with durable responses and encouraging survival. These findings suggest that dabrafenib plus trametinib is a promising targeted therapy option for children and adolescents with relapsed/refractory BRAF V600–mutant HGG.",2023-11-20,JCO.23.00558,"[{'Author': 'Darren R.

Methods: This randomized clinical trial was conducted from November 1, 2018, until August 31, 2021, in outpatient cancer clinics in Atlantic City, NJ, and Chicago, IL. Hourly low-wage worker members of an employer union health fund age 18 years or older with newly diagnosed solid tumor and hematologic malignancies were randomly assigned 1:1 to usual care (control group) or usual care augmented with a trained CHW for 12 months (intervention group). The CHW assisted participants with advance care planning (ACP), proactively screened symptoms, and referred participants to community-based resources for identified health-related social needs. Usual care comprised nurse case management and benefits redesign (waived copayments and free transportation for any cancer care received at preferred oncology clinics in each city). The primary outcome was HRQoL. Secondary outcomes included patient activation, satisfaction with decision, ACP documentation, health care use, total health care costs, and overall survival.

Results: A total of 160 participants were enrolled. Intervention group participants had a greater increase in mean HRQoL scores at 4-month and 12-month follow-up as compared with baseline than control group participants (expected mean difference, 11.25 [95% CI, 7.28 to 15.22]; 11.29 [95% CI, 6.96 to 15.62], respectively).

Digital monitoring consisted of between-visit online or automated telephone patient surveys about symptoms, functioning, and FT (single-item screening question from Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity) for up to 1 year, with automated alerts sent to practice nurses for concerning survey scores. Clinical team actions in response to alerts were not mandated. The primary outcome of this planned secondary analysis was development or worsening of financial difficulties, assessed via the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 financial difficulties measure, at any time compared with baseline. A randomly selected subset of patients and nurses were interviewed about their experiences with the intervention.

Results: One thousand one hundred ninety-one patients were enrolled (593 PRO; 598 control) at 52 US community oncology practices. Overall, 30.2% of patients treated at practices that received the FT screening intervention developed, or experienced worsening of, financial difficulties, compared with 39.0% treated at control practices (P = .004). Patients and nurses interviewed stated that FT screening identified patients for financial counseling who otherwise would be reluctant to seek, or unaware of the availability of, assistance.

Conclusion: In this report of a secondary outcome from a randomized clinical trial, FT screening as part of routine digital patient monitoring with PROs reduced the development, or worsening, of financial difficulties among patients undergoing systemic cancer therapy.",2023-10-10,JCO.22.02834,"[{'Author': 'Anna Weiss', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Myriad Genetics, Merck', 'Research Funding: Myriad Genetics (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Anna Rapperport', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation, Blueprint Medicines, Takeda']}, {'Author': 'Mattias Jonsson', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: GlaxoSmithKline, Epividian', 'Other Relationship: GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Takeda, Boehringer Ingelheim, AbbVie, UCB Bioscience (UCB) and Merck (past member)']}, {'Author': 'Patricia A.

Patients and Methods: This study is a post-trial follow-up of the ASTRRA trial, involving 1,483 premenopausal women younger than 45 years treated with definitive surgery after completing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to complete 5 years of tamoxifen (TAM) alone (TAM-only) or 5 years of TAM with ovarian function suppression (OFS) for 2 years (TAM + OFS). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary end point was overall survival (OS).

Results: At 106.4 months of median follow-up, there was a continuous significant reduction in the DFS event rate in the TAM + OFS group. The 8-year DFS rate was 85.4% in the TAM + OFS group and 80.2% in the TAM-only group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.87). There were no significant differences in OS between the two groups. The OS rate was 96.5% in the TAM + OFS group and 95.3% in the TAM-only group (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.25).

Conclusion: Adding OFS for 2 years to adjuvant TAM with a longer follow-up resulted in consistent DFS benefits, suggesting that adding OFS to TAM should be considered for patients who remain in a premenopausal state or resume ovarian function after chemotherapy.",2023-11-1,JCO.23.00557,"[{'Author': 'Soo Yeon Baek', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Takeda', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Gencurix']}, {'Author': 'Jai Min Ryu', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Intuitive Surgical', 'Research Funding: Medtronic']}, {'Author': 'Seung Il Kim', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Syantra']}, {'Author': 'Seock-Ah Im', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Novartis, Roche/Genentech, Eisai, Pfizer, Amgen, Hanmi, Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, MSD, Daiichi Sankyo', 'Research Funding: AstraZeneca (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Roche/Genentech (Inst), Daewoong Pharmaceutical (Inst), Eisai (Inst), Boryung Pharmaceuticals (Inst)', 'Other Relationship: Roche']}, {'Author': 'Kyong Hwa Park', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Celltrion']}, {'Author': 'Joon Jeong', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Bixink, Pfizer, Zeiss, Gencurix, Lilly, Amgen, Roche, MSD, Alvogen Korea, Medtronic, Boryung Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, Eisai, Hanmi, Takeda, Celltrion', 'Research Funding: Celltrion, Yuhan']}, {'Author': 'Hee Jeong Kim', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Alvogen Korea, Takeda', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

Methods: This single-arm phase II clinical trial enrolled patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC with untreated brain metastases without neurologic symptoms or asymptomatic with medical treatment. Dexamethasone was allowed up to 4 mg once daily. Atezolizumab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed was given for four to six cycles followed by atezolizumab plus pemetrexed until progression for a maximum of 2 years. The primary end points were to determine the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 12 weeks and the incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events during the first 9 weeks. Intracranial outcomes were assessed using response assessment in neuro-oncology brain metastases criteria.

Results: Forty patients were enrolled and 22 (55%) were receiving corticosteroids at baseline. The overall 12-week PFS rate was 62.2% (95% credibility interval [CrI], 47.1 to 76.2). The rate of grade 3/4 adverse events during the first 9 weeks was 27.5%. Most neurologic events were grade 1 and 2 but five patients (12.5%) experienced grade 3-4 neurologic events. With a median follow-up of 31 months, intracranial median PFS was 6.9 months and response rate was 42.7% (95% CrI, 28.1 to 57.9). Systemic median PFS was 8.9 months and response rate was 45% (95% CrI, 28.1 to 57.9). The median overall survival (OS) was 11.8 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 16.9) and the 2-year OS rate was 27.5% (95% CI, 16.6 to 45.5).

SAKK 06/17 investigated the addition of neoadjuvant durvalumab to gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy followed by radical surgery and adjuvant checkpoint inhibition with durvalumab.

Patients and Methods: SAKK 06/17 was an investigator-initiated, open-label, single-arm phase II study including cisplatin-fit patients with stage cT2-T4a cN0-1 operable MIUC. Four cycles of neoadjuvant GC in combination with four cycles of durvalumab (start with GC cycle 2) were administered, followed by radical surgery. Adjuvant durvalumab was given for 10 cycles. The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years.

Results: Sixty one patients were accrued at 12 sites. The full analysis set consisted of 57 patients, 54 (95%) had bladder cancer. Median follow-up was 40 months. The primary end point was met, with EFS at 2 years of 76% (one-sided 90% CI [lower bound], 67%; two-sided 95% CI, 62 to 85). EFS at 3 years was 73% (95% CI, 59 to 83). Complete pathologic response in resected patients (N = 52) was achieved in 17 patients (33%), and 31 (60%) had pathologic response <ypT2 ypN0. Overall survival (OS) was 85% (95% CI, 72 to 92) at 2 years and 81% (95% CI, 67 to 89) at 3 years. Grade 3 and 4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) during neoadjuvant treatment occurred in 42% and 25%, respectively. TRAEs related to adjuvant durvalumab were grade 3 in 5 (11%) and grade 4 in 2 (4%) patients.

Chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal cancer: phase III randomized Intergroup study 0099.,M  Al-Sarraf; M  LeBlanc; P G  Giri; K K  Fu; J  Cooper; T  Vuong; A A  Forastiere; G  Adams; W A  Sakr; D E  Schuller; J F  Ensley,,"Purpose: The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) coordinated an Intergroup study with the participation of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). This randomized phase III trial compared chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in patients with nasopharyngeal cancers.

Materials and Methods: Radiotherapy was administered in both arms: 1.8- to 2.0-Gy/d fractions Monday to Friday for 35 to 39 fractions for a total dose of 70 Gy. The investigational arm received chemotherapy with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22, and 43 during radiotherapy; postradiotherapy, chemotherapy with cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 1 and fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 4 was administered every 4 weeks for three courses. Patients were stratified by tumor stage, nodal stage, performance status, and histology.

Results: Of 193 patients registered, 147 (69 radiotherapy and 78 chemoradiotherapy) were eligible for primary analysis for survival and toxicity. The median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 15 months for eligible patients on the radiotherapy arm and was not reached for the chemo-radiotherapy group. The 3-year PFS rate was 24% versus 69%, respectively (P < .001). The median survival time was 34 months for the radiotherapy group and not reached for the chemo-radiotherapy group, and the 3-year survival rate was 47% versus 78%, respectively (P = .005). One hundred eighty-five patients were included in a secondary analysis for survival. The 3-year survival rate for patients randomized to radiotherapy was 46%, and for the chemoradiotherapy group was 76% (P < .001).

Conclusion: We conclude that chemoradiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone for patients with advanced nasopharyngeal cancers with respect to PFS and overall survival.",2023-8-20,JCO.22.02764,[]
Randomized Phase II Multicenter Trial of Abiraterone Acetate With or Without Cabazitaxel in the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer,Susan F.

Preclinical studies showed cabazitaxel had superior antitumor efficacy compared with docetaxel. Gene expression profiling revealed divergent effects of these taxanes in cycling cells. mCRPC are RB deficient rendering them hypersensitive to taxanes. These data suggested that upfront treatment with cabazitaxel with abiraterone may affect therapeutic response. We designed a phase II randomized noncomparative trial of abiraterone acetate/prednisone (AAP) or AAP and cabazitaxel (AAP + C) in men with mCRPC to address this hypothesis.

Methods: This trial of 81 men with mCRPC determined the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival, overall objective response, and safety of AAP or AAP + C. Equally allocated patients received AAP followed by switching to cabazitaxel upon radiographic progression (arm 1) or upfront with AAP + C (arm 2). Patients were stratified into high-/low-risk groups by the Halabi nomogram. Real-time assessment of RB status and circulating tumor cell (CTC) analysis to correlate with clinical outcomes was exploratory.

Results: Both treatment arms were well-tolerated. Median rPFS in AAP was 6.4 months (95% CI, 3.8 to 10.6) and median overall survival (OS) 18.3 months (95% CI, 14.4 to 37.6), respectively. Fifty-six percent of patients showed ≥50% decline in PSA. Median rPFS in AAP + C was 14.8 months (95% CI, 10.6 to 16.4), and median OS 24.5 months (95% CI, 20.4 to 35.0). There was a ≥50% decline in PSA in 92.1% of men. Neither RB expression in pretherapy tumor biopsy, CTC, or tissue explants identified those who may benefit from AAP + C.

Conclusion: AAP + C was safe with improved rPFS, OS duration, and a higher proportion of PSA declines. This suggests that AAP + C given earlier rather than sequentially may benefit some men. Further work is needed to identify this population.",2023-11-10,JCO.22.02639,"[{'Author': 'Susan F.

In contrast to cytotoxic chemotherapy, CDK4/6 inhibitors are given at a fixed dose, irrespective of BMI or weight. This preplanned analysis of the global randomized PALLAS trial investigates the impact of BMI on the side-effect profile, treatment adherence, and efficacy of palbociclib.

Methods: Patients were categorized at baseline according to WHO BMI categories. Neutropenia rates were assessed with univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Time to early discontinuation of palbociclib was analyzed with Fine and Gray competing risk models. Unstratified Cox models were used to investigate the association between BMI category and time to invasive disease-free survival (iDFS). 95% CIs were derived.

Results: Of 5,698 patients included in this analysis, 68 (1.2%) were underweight, 2,082 (36.5%) normal weight, 1,818 (31.9%) overweight, and 1,730 (30.4%) obese at baseline. In the palbociclib arm, higher BMI was associated with a significant decrease in neutropenia (unadjusted odds ratio for 1-unit change, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.94; adjusted for age, race ethnicity, region, chemotherapy use, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group at baseline, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.95). This translated into a significant decrease in treatment discontinuation rate with higher BMI (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for 10-unit change, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.83). There was no significant improvement in iDFS with the addition of palbociclib to ET in any weight category (normal weight HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.12; overweight HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.49; and obese HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.30) in this analysis early in follow-up (31 months).

Conclusion: This preplanned analysis of the PALLAS trial demonstrates a significant impact of BMI on side effects, dose reductions, early treatment discontinuation, and relative dose intensity. Additional long-term follow-up will further evaluate whether BMI ultimately affects outcome.",2023-11-20,JCO.23.00126,"[{'Author': 'Georg Pfeiler', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Amgen, Roche/Genentech, Pfizer, Lilly, AstraZeneca/Merck, AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo, Novartis, UCB, Accord Healthcare, Seagen, Gilead Sciences', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Pfizer, Amgen, Lilly, Novartis, AstraZeneca/Merck, AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo, UCB, Roche/Genentech, Gilead Sciences, Seagen', ""Speakers' Bureau: Roche/Genentech, Pfizer, Lilly, Novartis, UCB, AstraZeneca/Merck, AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo, Accord Healthcare, Amgen, Seagen, Gilead Sciences"", 'Research Funding: Accord Healthcare, Pfizer, Roche/Genentech, AstraZeneca (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Novartis, Lilly, Roche/Genentech, AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo, Gilead Sciences, Seagen']}, {'Author': 'Dominik Hlauschek', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Amgen (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Roche (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Sandoz (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Artera (Inst), Daiichi Sankyo (Inst), OncoMark (Inst), Cepheid (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Erica L.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IV TCC and no prior systemic chemotherapy were randomized to GC (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15; cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 2) or standard MVAC every 28 days for a maximum of six cycles.

RESULTS: Four hundred five patients were randomized (GC, n = 203; MVAC, n = 202). The groups were well-balanced with respect to prognostic factors. Overall survival was similar on both arms (hazards ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.32; P = .75), as were time to progressive disease (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.30), time to treatment failure (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.10), and response rate (GC, 49%; MVAC, 46%). More GC patients completed six cycles of therapy, with fewer dose adjustments. The toxic death rate was 1% on the GC arm and 3% on the MVAC arm. More GC than MVAC patients had grade 3/4 anemia (27% v 18%, respectively) and thrombocytopenia (57% v 21%, respectively). On both arms, the RBC transfusion rate was 13 of 100 cycles and grade 3/4 hemorrhage or hematuria was 2%; the platelet transfusion rate was four patients per 100 cycles and two patients per 100 cycles on GC and MVAC, respectively. More MVAC patients, compared with GC patients, had grade 3/4 neutropenia (82% v 71%, respectively), neutropenic fever (14% v 2%, respectively), neutropenic sepsis (12% v 1%, respectively), and grade 3/4 mucositis (22% v 1%, respectively) and alopecia (55% v 11%, respectively). Quality of life was maintained during treatment on both arms; however, more patients on GC fared better regarding weight, performance status, and fatigue.

CONCLUSION: GC provides a similar survival advantage to MVAC with a better safety profile and tolerability. This better-risk benefit ratio should change the standard of care for patients with locally advanced and metastatic TCC from MVAC to GC.",2023-8-10,JCO.22.02763,[]

Patients and Methods: PANDA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02904031) was an open-label, randomized phase II noncomparative trial in previously untreated patients age 70 years and older with unresectable RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to mFOLFOX + PAN (arm A) or 5-FU + LV + PAN (arm B) for up to 12 cycles, followed by PAN maintenance. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). In each arm, assuming a null hypothesis of median PFS time ≤6 months and target PFS ≥9.65, 90 patients per arm were needed to achieve 90% power and 5% type I error (one-sided Brookmeyer-Crowley test).

Results: Between July 2016 and April 2019, 91 patients were randomly assigned to arm A and 92 to arm B. At a median follow-up of 50.0 months (IQR, 45.6-56.4), median PFS was 9.6 and 9.0 months for arm A and B, respectively (P < .001 in each arm). Overall response rate was 69% and 52%, whereas median overall survival was 23.5 and 22.0 months in arm A and B, respectively. The overall rate of grade >2 chemotherapy-related adverse events was 60% and 37%, respectively. Baseline G8 and Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients scores were prognostic, but they were not associated with efficacy and safety of the two arms.

Conclusion: Both mFOLFOX and 5-FU + LV + PAN are reasonable options as initial therapy of elderly patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC. 5-FU + LV + PAN is associated with a better safety profile.",2023-12-1,JCO.23.00506,"[{'Author': 'Sara Lonardi', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Amgen, Merck Serono, Lilly, Servier, AstraZeneca, Incyte, Daiichi Sankyo, Bristol Myers Squibb, MSD, Astellas Pharma', ""Speakers' Bureau: Roche, Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb, Servier, Merck Serono, Pierre Fabre, GlaxoSmithKline, Amgen, MSD Oncology, Incyte"", 'Research Funding: Amgen, Merck Serono, Bayer (Inst), Roche (Inst), Lilly (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Riccardo Lobefaro', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Pfizer', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Daiichi Sankyo/Astra Zeneca', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Lilly']}, {'Author': 'Daniele Rossini', 'Disclosures': [""Speakers' Bureau: MSD Oncology, Amgen""]}, {'Author': 'Vincenzo Formica', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Amgen, Servier, MSD, Pierre Fabre, Merck Serono']}, {'Author': 'Mario Scartozzi', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: MSD, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, Servier, Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb/Sanofi, Rottapharm Biotech', ""Speakers' Bureau: MSD, Merck, Servier, GlaxoSmithKline, Bristol Myers Squibb/Sanofi, Amgen"", 'Research Funding: Sanofi', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Merck, MSD, Servier']}, {'Author': 'Samantha Di Donato', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Amgen, Merck Serono, Servier, Bayer', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bayer']}, {'Author': 'Francesca Bergamo', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Advanced Accelerator Applications/Novartis, Servier', ""Speakers' Bureau: Lilly, MSD Oncology, Eisai, Bayer""]}, {'Author': 'Alessandra Raimondi', 'Disclosures': [""Speakers' Bureau: Elma Academy, Servier"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Amgen']}, {'Author': 'Lorenzo Antonuzzo', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Amgen, Roche, AstraZeneca, Novartis']}, {'Author': 'Federica Morano', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Servier, Lilly, Pierre Fabre', 'Research Funding: Incyte (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Daiichi Sankyo/Astra Zeneca']}, {'Author': 'Fotios Loupakis', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: AstraZeneca']}, {'Author': 'Vittorina Zagonel', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer, Mundipharma', ""Speakers' Bureau: Bayer, Merck, Astellas Pharma"", 'Research Funding: Bayer (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Daiichi Sankyo/Lilly']}, {'Author': 'Matteo Fassan', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Astellas Pharma, GlaxoSmithKline, Roche, MSD Oncology, AstraZeneca, Pierre Fabre', 'Research Funding: Astellas Pharma, QED Therapeutics, Macrophage Pharma, Diaceutics']}, {'Author': 'Chiara Cremolini', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche, Amgen, Bayer, Servier, MSD, Merck, Pierre Fabre, Merck', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Bayer, Amgen, MSD, Pierre Fabre, Nordic Bioscience', ""Speakers' Bureau: Servier, Merck, Pierre Fabre"", 'Research Funding: Merck, Bayer, Roche, Servier']}, {'Author': 'Luca Boni', 'Disclosures': ['Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: International Patent Number PCT/EP2012/065661']}, {'Author': 'Filippo Pietrantonio', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Servier, Bayer, AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Lilly, MSD Oncology, Amgen, Pierre Fabre, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Serono, Astellas Pharma', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Amgen, Servier, MSD Oncology, Merck, Bayer, Merck Serono, Merck Serono', 'Research Funding: Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Incyte (Inst), Agenus (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pierre Fabre', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

However, the efficacy and safety of HHT-based induction therapy have not been confirmed for childhood AML, and ATRA-based treatment has not been evaluated among patients with non-APL AML.

Patients and Methods: This open-label, multicenter, randomized Chinese Children's Leukemia Group-AML 2015 study was performed across 35 centers in China. Patients with newly diagnosed childhood AML were first randomly assigned to receive an HHT-based (H arm) or etoposide-based (E arm) induction regimen and then randomly allocated to receive cytarabine-based (AC arm) or ATRA-based (AT arm) maintenance therapy. The primary end points were the complete remission (CR) rate after induction therapy, and the secondary end points were the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) at 3 years.

Results: We enrolled 1,258 patients, of whom 1,253 were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. The overall CR rate was significantly higher in the H arm than in the E arm (79.9% v 73.9%, P = .014). According to the intention-to-treat analysis, the 3-year OS was 69.2% (95% CI, 65.1 to 72.9) in the H arm and 62.8% (95% CI, 58.7 to 66.6) in the E arm (P = .025); the 3-year EFS was 61.1% (95% CI, 56.8 to 65.0) in the H arm and 53.4% (95% CI, 49.2 to 57.3) in the E arm (P = .022). Among the per-protocol population, who received maintenance therapy, the 3-year EFS did not differ significantly across the four arms (H + AT arm: 70.7%, 95% CI, 61.1 to 78.3; H + AC arm: 74.8%, 95% CI, 67.0 to 81.0, P = .933; E + AC arm: 72.9%, 95% CI, 65.1 to 79.2, P = .789; E + AT arm: 66.2%, 95% CI, 56.8 to 74.0, P = .336).

Conclusion: HHT is an alternative combination regimen for childhood AML. The effects of ATRA-based maintenance are comparable with those of cytarabine-based maintenance therapy.",2023-11-1,JCO.22.02836,[]

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

ARST1321 was a phase II study designed to compare the near complete pathologic response rate after preoperative chemoradiation with/without pazopanib in children and adults with intermediate-/high-risk chemotherapy-sensitive body wall/extremity non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcoma (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02180867). Enrollment was stopped early following a predetermined interim analysis that found the rate of near complete pathologic response to be significantly greater with the addition of pazopanib. As a planned secondary aim of the study, the outcome data for this cohort were analyzed. Eight-five eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive (regimen A) or not receive (regimen B) pazopanib in combination with ifosfamide and doxorubicin + preoperative radiotherapy followed by primary resection at week 13 and then further chemotherapy at week 25. As of December 31, 2021, at a median survivor follow-up of 3.3 years (range, 0.1-5.8 years), the 3-year event-free survival for all patients in the intent-to-treat analysis was 52.5% (95% CI, 34.8 to 70.2) for regimen A and 50.6% (95% CI, 32 to 69.2) for regimen B (P = .8677, log-rank test); the 3-year overall survival was 75.7% (95% CI, 59.7 to 91.7) for regimen A and 65.4% (95% CI, 48.1 to 82.7) for regimen B (P = .1919, log-rank test).

ROSEWOOD is a phase II, randomized study that assessed the efficacy and safety of ZO versus obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL).

Methods: Patients with R/R FL who had received ≥2 lines of therapy, including an anti-CD20 antibody and an alkylating agent, were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive ZO or obinutuzumab (O). The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) by independent central review (ICR). Secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and safety.

Results: A total of 217 patients were randomized (ZO, 145; O, 72). Median study follow-up was 20.2 months. The study met its primary end point: ORR by ICR was 69% (ZO) versus 46% (O; P = .001). Complete response rate was 39% (ZO) versus 19% (O); 18-month DOR rate was 69% (ZO) versus 42% (O). Median PFS was 28.0 months (ZO) versus 10.4 months (O; hazard ratio, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.75]; P < .001). The most common adverse events with ZO were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, and fatigue; incidences of atrial fibrillation and major hemorrhage were 3% and 1%, respectively.

Conclusion: The combination of ZO met its primary end point of a superior ORR versus O, and demonstrated meaningful activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with R/R FL.

As previously reported, COMBO450 improved progression-free survival (PFS) versus vemurafenib (part 1 primary end point) and ENCO300 (part 1 key secondary end point; not statistically significant). Part 2, requested by the US Food and Drug Administration, evaluated the contribution of binimetinib by maintaining the same encorafenib dosage in the combination (encorafenib 300 mg once daily plus binimetinib 45 mg twice daily [COMBO300]) and ENCO300 arms.

Methods: In part 2, patients were randomly assigned 3:1 to COMBO300 or ENCO300. ENCO300 (parts 1 and 2) data were combined, per protocol, for PFS analysis (key secondary end point) by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). Other analyses included overall response rate (ORR), overall survival, and safety.

Results: Two hundred fifty-eight patients received COMBO300, and 86 received ENCO300. Per protocol, ENCO300 arms (parts 1 and 2 combined) were also evaluated (n = 280). The median follow-up for ENCO300 was 40.8 months (part 1) and 57.1 months (part 2). The median PFS (95% CI) was 12.9 months (10.9 to 14.9) for COMBO300 versus 9.2  months (7.4 to 11.1) for ENCO300 (parts 1  and  2) and 7.4  months (5.6 to 9.2) for ENCO300 (part 2). The hazard ratio (95% CI) for COMBO300 was 0.74 (0.60 to 0.92; two-sided P = .003) versus ENCO300 (parts 1  and  2). The ORR by BIRC (95% CI) was 68% (62 to 74) and 51% (45 to 57) for COMBO300 and ENCO300 (parts 1  and  2), respectively. COMBO300 had greater relative dose intensity and fewer grade 3/4 adverse events than ENCO300.

Conclusion: COMBO300 improved PFS, ORR, and tolerability compared with ENCO300, confirming the contribution of binimetinib to efficacy and safety.",2023-10-10,JCO.22.02322,[]

We assessed the activity of atezolizumab (anti–PD-L1) in patients with advanced penile cancer, with or without radiotherapy (RT).

Patients and Methods: A single-center, nonrandomized phase II study with two treatment arms was conducted in 32 patients with histologically confirmed advanced penile cancer. All patients received atezolizumab (1,200 mg) once every 3 weeks. Twenty patients, who were expected to benefit from RT for locoregional disease control, received additional irradiation. The primary end point was 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) for the complete cohort and was reached if the actual 1-year PFS was at least 35%. Secondary end points included OS, objective response rate (ORR), and tolerability. Exploratory biomarker analyses were conducted in pretreatment specimens.

Results: Median follow-up was 29.1 months (IQR, 18.1-33.5). Grade 3-4 adverse events related to atezolizumab or RT were observed in 3/32 (9.4%) and 13/20 (65%) patients, respectively. One-year PFS was 12.5% (95% CI, 5.0 to 31.3), which did not meet the study's primary end point. Median OS was 11.3 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 18.7). In the objective response-evaluable population (n = 30; 93.8%), the ORR was 16.7% (95% CI, 6 to 35), including 2 (6.7%) complete responders and 3 (10%) partial responders. Improved PFS was observed in patients with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)–positive tumors (P = .003) and those with high infiltration of intratumoral CD3+CD8+ T cells (P = .037).

Conclusion: Although the primary end point of 1-year PFS was not met, durable antitumor activity to atezolizumab was observed in a subset of patients.

Implementation strategies directed at patients, clinicians, or both may increase tobacco use treatment (TUT) within oncology.

Methods: We conducted a four-arm cluster-randomized pragmatic trial across 11 clinical sites comparing the effect of strategies informed by behavioral economics on TUT engagement during oncology encounters with cancer patients. We delivered electronic health record (EHR)–based nudges promoting TUT across four nudge conditions: patient only, clinician only, patient and clinician, or usual care. Nudges were designed to counteract cognitive biases that reduce TUT engagement. The primary outcome was TUT penetration, defined as the proportion of patients with documented TUT referral or a medication prescription in the EHR. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the parameters of a linear model.

Results: From June 2021 to July 2022, we randomly assigned 246 clinicians in 95 clusters, and collected TUT penetration data from their encounters with 2,146 eligible patients who smoke receiving oncologic care. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed that the clinician nudge led to a significant increase in TUT penetration versus usual care (35.6% v 13.5%; OR = 3.64; 95% CI, 2.52 to 5.24; P < .0001). Completer-only analysis (N = 1,795) showed similar impact (37.7% clinician nudge v 13.5% usual care; OR = 3.77; 95% CI, 2.73 to 5.19; P < .0001). Clinician type affected TUT penetration, with physicians less likely to provide TUT than advanced practice providers (ITT OR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.88; P = .004).

Conclusion: EHR nudges, informed by behavioral economics and aimed at oncology clinicians, appear to substantially increase TUT penetration. Adding patient nudges to the implementation strategy did not affect TUT penetration rates.",2023-10-1,JCO.23.00355,"[{'Author': 'Rinad S.

Patients and Methods: Patients with MCRC were randomly assigned, in a 2 × 2 factorial design, to XELOX versus FOLFOX-4, and then to bevacizumab versus placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).

Results: A total of 1,401 patients were randomly assigned in this 2 × 2 analysis. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.4 months in the bevacizumab group and 8.0 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 97.5% CI, 0.72 to 0.95; P = .0023). Median overall survival was 21.3 months in the bevacizumab group and 19.9 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.89; 97.5% CI, 0.76 to 1.03; P = .077). Response rates were similar in both arms. Analysis of treatment withdrawals showed that, despite protocol allowance of treatment continuation until disease progression, only 29% and 47% of bevacizumab and placebo recipients, respectively, were treated until progression. The toxicity profile of bevacizumab was consistent with that documented in previous trials.

Conclusion: The addition of bevacizumab to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improved PFS in this first-line trial in patients with MCRC. Overall survival differences did not reach statistical significance, and response rate was not improved by the addition of bevacizumab. Treatment continuation until disease progression may be necessary in order to optimize the contribution of bevacizumab to therapy.",2023-7-20,JCO.22.02760,[]

BensonIII,IL; IL; IL; IL; IL; IL; IL; IL,"Purpose: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy improves survival in previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. This study was conducted to determine the effect of bevacizumab (at 10 mg/kg) on survival duration for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer.

Patients and Methods: Eight hundred twenty-nine metastatic colorectal cancer patients previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) with bevacizumab; FOLFOX4 without bevacizumab; or bevacizumab alone. The primary end point was overall survival, with additional determinations of progression-free survival, response, and toxicity.

Results: The median duration of survival for the group treated with FOLFOX4 and bevacizumab was 12.9 months compared with 10.8 months for the group treated with FOLFOX4 alone (corresponding hazard ratio for death = 0.75; P = .0011), and 10.2 months for those treated with bevacizumab alone. The median progression-free survival for the group treated with FOLFOX4 in combination with bevacizumab was 7.3 months, compared with 4.7 months for the group treated with FOLFOX4 alone (corresponding hazard ratio for progression = 0.61; P < .0001), and 2.7 months for those treated with bevacizumab alone. The corresponding overall response rates were 22.7%, 8.6%, and 3.3%, respectively (P < .0001 for FOLFOX4 with bevacizumab v FOLFOX4 comparison). Bevacizumab was associated with hypertension, bleeding, and vomiting.

Conclusion: The addition of bevacizumab to oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin improves survival duration for patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer.",2023-7-20,JCO.22.02761,[]

This phase III study investigated two sequences: folinic acid, FU, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) followed by folinic acid, FU, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX6; arm A), and FOLFOX6 followed by FOLFIRI (arm B).

Patients and Methods: Previously untreated patients with assessable disease were randomly assigned to receive a 2-hour infusion of l-LV 200 mg/m2 or dl-LV 400 mg/m2 followed by a FU bolus 400 mg/m2 and 46-hour infusion 2,400 to 3,000 mg/m2 every 46 hours every 2 weeks, either with irinotecan 180 mg/m2 or with oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion on day 1. At progression, irinotecan was replaced by oxaliplatin (arm A), or oxaliplatin by irinotecan (arm B).

Results: Median survival was 21.5 months in 109 patients allocated to FOLFIRI then FOLFOX6 versus 20.6 months in 111 patients allocated to FOLFOX6 then FOLFIRI (P = .99). Median second progression-free survival (PFS) was 14.2 months in arm A versus 10.9 in arm B (P = .64). In first-line therapy, FOLFIRI achieved 56% response rate (RR) and 8.5 months median PFS, versus FOLFOX6 which achieved 54% RR and 8.0 months median PFS (P = .26). Second-line FOLFIRI achieved 4% RR and 2.5 months median PFS, versus FOLFOX6 which achieved 15% RR and 4.2 months PFS. In first-line therapy, National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3/4 mucositis, nausea/vomiting, and grade 2 alopecia were more frequent with FOLFIRI, and grade 3/4 neutropenia and neurosensory toxicity were more frequent with FOLFOX6.

In this study, we compared the activity and toxicity of three different two-drug combinations in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had not been treated previously for advanced disease.

Patients and Methods: Patients were concurrently randomly assigned to receive irinotecan and bolus fluorouracil plus leucovorin (IFL, control combination), oxaliplatin and infused fluorouracil plus leucovorin (FOLFOX), or irinotecan and oxaliplatin (IROX). The primary end point was time to progression, with secondary end points of response rate, survival time, and toxicity.

Results: A total of 795 patients were randomly assigned between May 1999 and April 2001. A median time to progression of 8.7 months, response rate of 45%, and median survival time of 19.5 months were observed for FOLFOX. These results were significantly superior to those observed for IFL for all end points (6.9 months, 31%, and 15.0 months, respectively) or for IROX (6.5 months, 35%, and 17.4 months, respectively) for time to progression and response. The FOLFOX regimen had significantly lower rates of severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, and dehydration. Sensory neuropathy and neutropenia were more common with the regimens containing oxaliplatin.

Conclusion: The FOLFOX regimen of oxaliplatin and infused fluorouracil plus leucovorin was active and comparatively safe. It should be considered as a standard therapy for patients with advanced colorectal cancer.",2023-7-1,JCO.22.02759,[]

This global, phase III study (LASER301) compared lazertinib versus gefitinib in treatment-naïve patients with EGFR-mutated (exon 19 deletion [ex19del]/L858R) locally advanced or metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Patients and Methods: Patients were 18 years and older with no previous systemic anticancer therapy. Neurologically stable patients with CNS metastases were allowed. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to lazertinib 240 mg once daily orally or gefitinib 250 mg once daily orally, stratified by mutation status and race. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST v1.1.

Results: Overall, 393 patients received double-blind study treatment across 96 sites in 13 countries. Median PFS was significantly longer with lazertinib than with gefitinib (20.6 v 9.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.58; P < .001). The PFS benefit of lazertinib over gefitinib was consistent across all predefined subgroups. The objective response rate was 76% in both groups (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.59). Median duration of response was 19.4 months (95% CI, 16.6 to 24.9) with lazertinib versus 8.3 months (95% CI, 6.9 to 10.9) with gefitinib. Overall survival data were immature at the interim analysis (29% maturity). The 18-month survival rate was 80% with lazertinib and 72% with gefitinib (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.08; P = .116). Observed safety of both treatments was consistent with their previously reported safety profiles.

Levis,PA; NJ; IL; OH; CT; TX; KS; CA; NY; OK; IL; IL; IL; IL; IL; IL; PA; MD,"Purpose: Gilteritinib is a type 1 FLT3 inhibitor active as monotherapy for relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML. We investigated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of gilteritinib incorporated into intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy, and as maintenance therapy for adult patients with newly diagnosed, non–favorable-risk AML.

Methods: In this phase IB study (2215-CL-0103; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02236013), 103 participants were screened and 80 were allocated to treatment. The study was divided into four parts: dose escalation, dose expansion, investigation of alternate anthracycline and gilteritinib schedule, and continuous gilteritinib during consolidation.

Results: After dose escalation, 120 mg gilteritinib once daily was chosen for further study. There were 58 participants evaluable for response at this dose, 36 of whom harbored FLT3 mutations. For participants with FLT3-mutated AML, the composite complete response (CRc) rate was 89% (83% were conventional complete responses), all achieved after a single induction cycle. The median overall survival time was 46.1 months. Gilteritinib was well-tolerated in this context although the median time to count recovery during induction was approximately 40 days. Longer time-to-count recovery was associated with higher trough levels of gilteritinib, which, in turn, were associated with azole use. The recommended regimen is gilteritinib at a dose of 120 mg once daily from days 4 to 17 or 8 to 21 of a 7 + 3 induction with either idarubicin or daunorubicin and from day 1 continuously with high-dose cytarabine consolidation. Maintenance therapy with gilteritinib was well-tolerated.

Conclusion: These results demonstrated the safety and tolerability of gilteritinib incorporated into an induction and consolidation chemotherapy regimen, and as single-agent maintenance therapy for patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutant AML. The data herein provide an important framework for the design of randomized trials comparing gilteritinib with other FLT3 inhibitors.",2023-9-10,JCO.22.02721,"[{'Author': 'Angela J.

Rosenberg,IL; NC; CT; NC; CO; CA; CA; CA; CA; GA; CA; NC; TX; NY; PA; Italy; France; France; Spain; Canada; WA; WA; IL; NJ; NY,"Purpose: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (la/mUC) who are ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy have limited first-line (1L) treatment options and significant need for improved therapies. Enfortumab vedotin (EV) and pembrolizumab (Pembro) individually have shown a survival benefit in urothelial cancer in second-line + la/mUC settings. Here, we present data from the pivotal trial of EV plus Pembro (EV + Pembro) in the 1L setting.

Patients and Methods: In Cohort K of the EV-103 phase Ib/II study, cisplatin-ineligible patients with previously untreated la/mUC were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive EV as monotherapy or in combination with Pembro. The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (cORR) per blinded independent central review. Secondary end points included duration of response (DOR) and safety. There were no formal statistical comparisons between treatment arms.

Results: The cORR was 64.5% (95% CI, 52.7 to 75.1) and 45.2% (95% CI, 33.5 to 57.3) for patients treated with EV + Pembro (N = 76) and EV monotherapy (N = 73), respectively. The median DOR was not reached for the combination and was 13.2 months for monotherapy; 65.4% and 56.3% of patients who responded to the combination and monotherapy, respectively, maintained a response at 12 months. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in patients treated with the combination were maculopapular rash (17.1%), fatigue (9.2%), and neutropenia (9.2%). EV TRAEs of special interest (any grade) in the combination arm included skin reactions (67.1%) and peripheral neuropathy (60.5%).

Conclusion: EV + Pembro showed a high cORR with durable responses as 1L treatment in cisplatin-ineligible patients with la/mUC. Patients who received EV monotherapy had a response and safety profile consistent with previous studies. Adverse events for EV + Pembro were manageable, with no new safety signals observed.",2023-9-1,JCO.22.02887,"[{'Author': ""Peter H.

Tudor; Domenica  Lorusso,Italy; Italy; Belgium; MA; Spain; NY; IL; PA; CA; CA; CA; CA; CA; Italy,"Purpose: Despite therapeutic advances, outcomes for patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer remain poor. Selective glucocorticoid receptor modulation with relacorilant may restore chemosensitivity and enhance chemotherapy efficacy.

Methods: This three-arm, randomized, controlled, open-label phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03776812) enrolled women with recurrent, platinum-resistant/refractory, high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, or ovarian carcinosarcoma treated with ≤4 prior chemotherapeutic regimens. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to (1) nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) + intermittent relacorilant (150 mg the day before, of, and after nab-paclitaxel); (2) nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) + continuous relacorilant (100 mg once daily); or (3) nab-paclitaxel monotherapy (100 mg/m2). Nab-paclitaxel was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment; objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), and safety were secondary end points.

Results: A total of 178 women were randomly assigned. Intermittent relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; log-rank test P = .038; median follow-up, 11.1 months) and DOR (HR, 0.36; P = .006) versus nab-paclitaxel monotherapy, while ORR was similar across arms. At the preplanned OS analysis (median follow-up, 22.5 months), the OS HR was 0.67 (P = .066) for the intermittent arm versus nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. Continuous relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel showed numerically improved median PFS but did not result in significant improvement over nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. Adverse events were comparable across study arms, with neutropenia, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and fatigue/asthenia being the most common grade ≥3 adverse events.

Conclusion: Intermittent relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel improved PFS, DOR, and OS compared with nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. On the basis of protocol-prespecified Hochberg step-up multiplicity adjustment, the primary end point did not reach statistical significance (P < .025).

FOLFOXIRI Plus Cetuximab or Bevacizumab as First-Line Treatment of BRAFV600E-Mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: The Randomized Phase II FIRE-4.5 (AIO KRK0116) Study,Sebastian  Stintzing; Kathrin  Heinrich; David  Tougeron; Dominik Paul  Modest; Ingo  Schwaner; Jan  Eucker; Rudolf  Pihusch; Martina  Stauch; Florian  Kaiser; Christoph  Kahl; Meinolf  Karthaus; Christian  Müller; Christof  Burkart; Anke  Reinacher-Schick; Stefan  Kasper-Virchow; Ludwig  Fischer von Weikersthal; Beate  Krammer-Steiner; Gerald Wolfgang  Prager; Julien  Taieb; Volker  Heinemann,Germany; Germany; Germany; France; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Austria; France; France; Germany; France,"Purpose: BRAFV600E mutation is associated with a poor outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This clinical trial investigated the efficacy of triplet chemotherapy (fluorouracil, folinic acid, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) combined with either cetuximab or bevacizumab in patients with previously untreated BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC.

Patients and Methods: In this controlled, randomized, open-label phase II trial, 109 patients were randomly assigned, 107 of whom were included into the full analysis set (FAS). Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab in the experimental arm (n = 72) or FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab in the control arm (n = 35). The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1., evaluated in patients treated according to protocol (ATP population). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and feasibility were analyzed as secondary end points.

Results: Eighteen patients discontinued study treatment before the first tumor assessment, thus resulting in the ATP population of 89 patients. In these patients, ORR was 51% (30/59) in the cetuximab-based experimental arm and 67% (20/30) in the bevacizumab-based control arm (odds ratio, 1.93; 80% CI, 1.06 to 3.52; P = .92 [one-sided]). In the full analysis set, median PFS was significantly inferior in the experimental arm (6.7 months v 10.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.89; P = .006). Median OS analyzed at an event rate of 64.5% showed a trend toward shorter survival in cetuximab-treated patients (12.9 months v 17.1 months; HR, 1.4; P = .20).

Conclusion: To our knowledge, FIRE-4.5 is the first prospective and randomized study investigating first-line treatment of BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC. FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab does not induce a higher ORR when compared with FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab in first-line treatment of BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC. Bevacizumab-based chemotherapy remains the preferable first-line treatment of patients with BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC.",2023-9-1,JCO.22.01420,"[{'Author': 'Sebastian Stintzing', 'Disclosures':

Patients and Methods: In AMEERA-3 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04059484), an open-label, worldwide phase II trial, patients with ER+/HER2– aBC who progressed in the (neo)adjuvant or advanced settings after not more than two previous lines of endocrine therapy (ET) were randomly assigned 1:1 to amcenestrant or single-agent endocrine treatment of physician's choice (TPC), stratified by the presence/absence of visceral metastases, previous/no treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0/1). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by independent central review, compared using a stratified log-rank test (one-sided type I error rate of 2.5%).

Results: Between October 22, 2019, and February 15, 2021, 290 patients were randomly assigned to amcenestrant (n = 143) or TPC (n = 147). PFS was numerically similar between amcenestrant and TPC (median PFS [mPFS], 3.6 v 3.7 months; stratified hazard ratio [HR], 1.051 [95% CI, 0.789 to 1.4]; one-sided P = .643). Among patients with baseline mutated ESR1; (n = 120 of 280), amcenestrant numerically prolonged PFS versus TPC (mPFS, 3.7 v 2.0 months; stratified HR, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.565 to 1.435]). Overall survival data were immature but numerically similar between groups (HR, 0.913; 95% CI, 0.595 to 1.403). In amcenestrant versus TPC groups, treatment-emergent adverse events (any grade) occurred in 82.5% versus 76.2% of patients and grade ≥3 events occurred in 21.7% versus 15.6%.

Conclusion: AMEERA-3 did not meet its primary objective of improved PFS with amcenestrant versus TPC although a numerical improvement in PFS was observed in patients with baseline ESR1 mutation.

We aimed to compare outcomes of the BuFlu regimen with those of the BuCy regimen in HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT).

Methods: We performed an open-label, randomized phase III trial at 12 hospitals in China. Eligible patients with AML (18-65 years) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive BuFlu (busulfan 0.8 mg/kg four times per day on days –6 to –3; fludarabine 30 mg/m2 once daily on days –7 to –3) or BuCy (same dose of busulfan; cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg once daily on days –3 and –2). The primary end point was 1-year TRM in the intention-to-treat population and safety in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02487069) and is complete.

Results: From November 20, 2015, to September 30, 2019, 386 patients were randomly assigned to receive the BuFlu (n = 194) or BuCy (n = 192) regimen. The median follow-up was 55.0 (IQR, 46.5-69.0) months after random assignment. The 1-year TRM was 7.2% (95% CI, 4.1 to 11.4) and 14.1% (95% CI, 9.6 to 19.4; hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.97; P = .041), the 5-year relapse was 17.9% (95% CI, 9.6 to 28.3) and 14.2% (95% CI, 9.1 to 20.5; HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.95; P = .670), and the 5-year overall survival was 72.5% (95% CI, 62.2 to 80.4) and 68.2% (95% CI, 58.9 to 75.9; HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.26; P = .465) in two groups, respectively. Grade 3 regimen-related toxicity (RRT) was reported for 0 of 191 patients following the BuFlu regimen and 9 (4.7%) of 190 patients following the BuCy regimen (P = .002). At least one type of grade 3-5 adverse event was reported for 130 (68.1%) of the 191 patients and 147 (77.4%) of the 190 patients in two groups, respectively (P = .041).

Conclusion: The BuFlu regimen has a lower TRM and RRT and similar relapse for patients with AML undergoing haplo-HCT compared with the BuCy regimen.",2023-10-10,JCO.23.00101,[]

Patients and Methods: Adults with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC received 0.27-10 mg/kg Dato-DXd once every 3 weeks during escalation or 4, 6, or 8 mg/kg Dato-DXd once every 3 weeks during expansion. Primary end points were safety and tolerability. Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), survival, and pharmacokinetics.

Results: Two hundred ten patients received Dato-DXd, including 180 in the 4-8 mg/kg dose-expansion cohorts. This population had a median of three prior lines of therapy. The maximum tolerated dose was 8 mg/kg once every 3 weeks; the recommended dose for further development was 6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. In patients receiving 6 mg/kg (n = 50), median duration on study, including follow-up, and median exposure were 13.3 and 3.5 months, respectively. The most frequent any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were nausea (64%), stomatitis (60%), and alopecia (42%). Grade ≥3 TEAEs and treatment-related AEs occurred in 54% and 26% of patients, respectively. Interstitial lung disease adjudicated as drug-related (two grade 2 and one grade 4) occurred in three of 50 patients (6%). The ORR was 26% (95% CI, 14.6 to 40.3), and median duration of response was 10.5 months; median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.9 months (95% CI, 2.7 to 8.8 months) and 11.4 months (95% CI, 7.1 to 20.6 months), respectively. Responses occurred regardless of TROP2 expression.

Sandler",MO; PA; VA; GA; TN; CA; MO; TX; Canada; Canada; DE; MO; AZ; TX; NC; CA; MA; CA; PA; CA,"Purpose: To determine whether addition of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to brachytherapy (BT) (COMBO) compared with BT alone would improve 5-year freedom from progression (FFP) in intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

Methods: Men with prostate cancer stage cT1c-T2bN0M0, Gleason Score (GS) 2-6 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 10-20 or GS 7, and PSA < 10 were eligible. The COMBO arm was EBRT (45 Gy in 25 fractions) to prostate and seminal vesicles followed by BT prostate boost (110 Gy if 125-Iodine, 100 Gy if 103-Pd). BT arm was delivered to prostate only (145 Gy if 125-Iodine, 125 Gy if 103-Pd). The primary end point was FFP: PSA failure (American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology [ASTRO] or Phoenix definitions), local failure, distant failure, or death.

Results: Five hundred eighty-eight men were randomly assigned; 579 were eligible: 287 and 292 in COMBO and BT arms, respectively. The median age was 67 years; 89.1% had PSA < 10 ng/mL, 89.1% had GS 7, and 66.7% had T1 disease. There were no differences in FFP. The 5-year FFP-ASTRO was 85.6% (95% CI, 81.4 to 89.7) with COMBO compared with 82.7% (95% CI, 78.3 to 87.1) with BT (odds ratio [OR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.26; Greenwood T P = .18). The 5-year FFP-Phoenix was 88.0% (95% CI, 84.2 to 91.9) with COMBO compared with 85.5% (95% CI, 81.3 to 89.6) with BT (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.30; Greenwood T P = .19). There were no differences in the rates of genitourinary (GU) or GI acute toxicities. The 5-year cumulative incidence for late GU/GI grade 2+ toxicity is 42.8% (95% CI, 37.0 to 48.6) for COMBO compared with 25.8% (95% CI, 20.9 to 31.0) for BT (P < .0001). The 5-year cumulative incidence for late GU/GI grade 3+ toxicity is 8.2% (95% CI, 5.4 to 11.8) compared with 3.8% (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.5; P = .006).

Conclusion: Compared with BT, COMBO did not improve FFP for prostate cancer but caused greater toxicity. BT alone can be considered as a standard treatment for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.",2023-8-20,JCO.22.01856,"[{'Author': 'Jeff M.

Methods: Treatment-naive patients with unresectable stage III-IV melanoma received nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (four doses) followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg (240 mg following a protocol amendment) once every 2 weeks for ≤24 months. The primary end point was the incidence of grade 3-5 select treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Overall survival (OS) was a secondary end point. Outcomes were evaluated in subgroups defined by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), brain metastasis status, and melanoma subtype.

Results: In total, 533 patients received at least one dose of study drug. Grade 3-5 select TRAEs affecting the GI (16%), hepatic (15%), endocrine (11%), skin (7%), renal (2%), and pulmonary (1%) systems occurred in the all-treated population; similar incidence rates were observed across all subgroups. At 21.6 months' median follow-up, 24-month OS rates were 63% in the all-treated population, 44% in the ECOG PS 2 subgroup (including patients with cutaneous melanoma only), 71% in the brain metastasis subgroup, 36% in the ocular/uveal melanoma subgroup, and 38% in the mucosal melanoma subgroup.

Conclusion: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab followed by nivolumab monotherapy was tolerable in patients with advanced melanoma and poor prognostic characteristics. Efficacy was similar between the all-treated population and patients with brain metastases. Reduced efficacy was observed in patients with ECOG PS 2, ocular/uveal melanoma, and/or mucosal melanoma, highlighting the continued need for novel treatment options for these difficult-to-treat patients.",2023-8-10,JCO.22.02199,"[{'Author': 'Reinhard Dummer', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Amgen, Takeda, Pierre Fabre, Sun Pharma, Sanofi, Catalym, Second Genome, Regeneron, Alligator Bioscience, MaxiVax, touchIME, T3 Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis, Amgen, Takeda, Pierre Fabre, Sun Pharma, Sanofi, Catalym, Second Genome, Alligator Bioscience, touchIME, MaxiVax, Regeneron, Pfizer, T3 Pharmaceuticals', 'Research Funding: Roche (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Merck Sharp & Dohme (Inst), Amgen (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Pippa Corrie', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Novartis, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Pierre Fabre, Bristol Myers Squibb', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Pierre Fabre, Microbiotica', ""Speakers' Bureau: Merck Sharp & Dohme, Pierre Fabre"", 'Research Funding: Merck Sharp & Dohme (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Iovance Biotherapeutics (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Ralf Gutzmer', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Roche/Genentech, Novartis, Merck Serono, Almirall Hermal GmbH, Amgen, Sun Pharma, Pierre Fabre, Sanofi/Regeneron, Immunocore', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Roche/Genentech, Novartis, Almirall Hermal GmbH, 4SC, Amgen, Pierre Fabre, Merck Serono, Sun Pharma, Sanofi, Immunocore', 'Research Funding: Novartis (Inst), Amgen (Inst), Merck Serono (Inst), Sun Pharma (Inst), Sanofi (Inst), Kyowa Kirin (Inst), Almirall Hermal GmbH (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bristol Myers Squibb, Pierre Fabre, Sun Pharma, Boehringer Ingelheim']}, {'Author': 'Tarek M.

This multicenter trial presents the second-part long-term efficacy and safety results of eltrombopag in patients with low-risk MDS and severe thrombocytopenia.

Methods: In this single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase-II trial of adult patients with International Prognostic Scoring System low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS, patients with a stable platelet (PLT) count (<30 × 103/mm3) received eltrombopag or placebo until disease progression. Primary end points were duration of PLT response (PLT-R; calculated from the time of PLT-R to date of loss of PLT-R, defined as bleeding/PLT count <30 × 103/mm3 or last date in observation) and long-term safety and tolerability. Secondary end points included incidence and severity of bleeding, PLT transfusions, quality of life, leukemia-free survival, progression-free survival, overall survival and pharmacokinetics.

Results: From 2011 to 2021, of 325 patients screened, 169 patients were randomly assigned oral eltrombopag (N = 112) or placebo (N = 57) at a starting dose of 50 mg once daily to maximum of 300 mg. PLT-R, with 25-week follow-up (IQR, 14-68) occurred in 47/111 (42.3%) eltrombopag patients versus 6/54 (11.1%) in placebo (odds ratio, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.3 to 14.9; P < .001). In eltrombopag patients, 12/47 (25.5%) lost the PLT-R, with cumulative thrombocytopenia relapse-free survival at 60 months of 63.6% (95% CI, 46.0 to 81.2). Clinically significant bleeding (WHO bleeding score ≥ 2) occurred less frequently in the eltrombopag arm than in the placebo group (incidence rate ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.75; P = .0002). Although no difference in the frequency of grade 1-2 adverse events (AEs) was observed, a higher proportion of eltrombopag patients experienced grade 3-4 AEs (χ2 = 9.5, P = .002). AML evolution and/or disease progression occurred in 17% (for both) of eltrombopag and placebo patients with no difference in survival times.

Conclusion: Eltrombopag was effective and relatively safe in low-risk MDS with severe thrombocytopenia.

The phase III, open-label KEYLYNK-010 study evaluated pembrolizumab plus olaparib versus a next-generation hormonal agent (NHA) for biomarker-unselected, previously treated mCRPC.

Methods: Eligible participants had mCRPC that progressed on or after abiraterone or enzalutamide (but not both) and docetaxel. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to pembrolizumab plus olaparib or NHA (abiraterone or enzalutamide). The dual primary end points were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) by blinded independent central review per Prostate Cancer Working Group–modified RECIST 1.1 and overall survival (OS). Time to first subsequent therapy (TFST) was a key secondary end point. Safety and objective response rate (ORR) were secondary end points.

Results: Between May 30, 2019, and July 16, 2021, 529 participants were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab plus olaparib and 264 to NHA. At final rPFS analysis, median rPFS was 4.4 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.0) with pembrolizumab plus olaparib and 4.2 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 6.1) with NHA (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.25]; P = .55). At final OS analysis, median OS was 15.8 months (95% CI, 14.6 to 17.0) and 14.6 months (95% CI, 12.6 to 17.3), respectively (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.14]; P = .26). At final TFST analysis, median TFST was 7.2 months (95% CI, 6.7 to 8.1) versus 5.7 months (95% CI, 5.0 to 7.1), respectively (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.71 to 1.03]). ORR was higher with pembrolizumab plus olaparib versus NHA (16.8% v 5.9%). Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 34.6% and 9.0% of participants, respectively.

Conclusion: Pembrolizumab plus olaparib did not significantly improve rPFS or OS versus NHA in participants with biomarker-unselected, heavily pretreated mCRPC. The study was stopped for futility.

Johnson,NY; the Netherlands; South Korea; Spain; GA; TX; TN; Italy; FL; Spain; NY; Spain; NC; FL; OH; MA; CA; MO; PA; Italy; NY; CA; CA; Poland; MA,"Purpose: The combination of encorafenib (BRAF inhibitor) plus binimetinib (MEK inhibitor) has demonstrated clinical efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in patients with BRAFV600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of encorafenib plus binimetinib in patients with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods: In this ongoing, open-label, single-arm, phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03915951), patients with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC received oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus binimetinib 45 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by independent radiology review (IRR). Secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, time to response, and safety.

Results: At data cutoff, 98 patients (59 treatment-naïve and 39 previously treated) with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC received encorafenib plus binimetinib. Median duration of treatment was 9.2 months with encorafenib and 8.4 months with binimetinib. ORR by IRR was 75% (95% CI, 62 to 85) in treatment-naïve and 46% (95% CI, 30 to 63) in previously treated patients; median DOR was not estimable (NE; 95% CI, 23.1 to NE) and 16.7 months (95% CI, 7.4 to NE), respectively. DCR after 24 weeks was 64% in treatment-naïve and 41% in previously treated patients. Median PFS was NE (95% CI, 15.7 to NE) in treatment-naïve and 9.3 months (95% CI, 6.2 to NE) in previously treated patients. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were nausea (50%), diarrhea (43%), and fatigue (32%). TRAEs led to dose reductions in 24 (24%) and permanent discontinuation of encorafenib plus binimetinib in 15 (15%) patients. One grade 5 TRAE of intracranial hemorrhage was reported. Interactive visualization of the data presented in this article is available at the PHAROS dashboard (https://clinical-trials.dimensions.ai/pharos/).

Conclusion: For patients with treatment-naïve and previously treated BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC, encorafenib plus binimetinib showed a meaningful clinical benefit with a safety profile consistent with that observed in the approved indication in melanoma.",2023-7-20,JCO.23.00774,"[{'Author': 'Gregory J.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is an alternative that may spare patients the morbidity of radiation. Understanding the relative patient experiences with these options is necessary to inform treatment decisions.

Methods: PROSPECT was a multicenter, unblinded, noninferiority, randomized trial of neoadjuvant FOLFOX versus 5FUCRT, which enrolled adults with rectal cancer clinically staged as T2N+, cT3N–, or cT3N+ who were candidates for sphincter-sparing surgery. Neoadjuvant FOLFOX was given in six cycles over 12 weeks, followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant 5FUCRT was delivered in 28 fractions over 5.5 weeks, followed by surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy was suggested but not mandated in both groups. Enrolled patients were asked to provide patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at baseline, during neoadjuvant treatment, and at 12 months after surgery. PROs included 14 symptoms from the National Cancer Institute's Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE). Additional PRO instruments measured bowel, bladder, sexual function, and health-related quality of life (HRQL).

Results: From June 2012 to December 2018, 1,194 patients were randomly assigned, 1,128 initiated treatment, and 940 contributed PRO-CTCAE data (493 FOLFOX; 447 5FUCRT). During neoadjuvant treatment, patients reported significantly lower rates of diarrhea and better overall bowel function with FOLFOX while anxiety, appetite loss, constipation, depression, dysphagia, dyspnea, edema, fatigue, mucositis, nausea, neuropathy, and vomiting were lower with 5FUCRT (all multiplicity adjusted P < .05). At 12 months after surgery, patients randomly assigned to FOLFOX reported significantly lower rates of fatigue and neuropathy and better sexual function versus 5FUCRT (all multiplicity adjusted P < .05). Neither bladder function nor HRQL differed between groups at any time point.

Conclusion: For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer choosing between neoadjuvant FOLFOX and 5FUCRT, the distinctive PRO profiles inform treatment selection and shared decision making.",2023-7-20,JCO.23.00903,"[{'Author': 'Ethan Basch', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Sivan Innovation, Navigating Cancer, AstraZeneca, Resilience Care', 'Other Relationship: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, National Cancer Institute, American Society of Clinical Oncology, JAMA—Journal of the American Medical Association, Patient-Centered OUtcomes Research Institute (PCORI)', 'Open Payments Link: https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/physician/427875']}, {'Author': 'Harvey Mamon', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: UpToDate', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Merck Sharp & Dohme']}, {'Author': 'Martin Weiser', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Precisca', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: UpToDate Section Editor']}, {'Author': 'Leonard Saltz', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Genor BioPharma']}, {'Author': 'Marc Gollub', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Pfizer']}, {'Author': 'George Chang', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Medicaroid']}, {'Author': 'Gita Thanarajasingam', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Seagen (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Benjamin Musher', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Exelixis', ""Speakers' Bureau: Ipsen"", 'Research Funding: Lokon Pharma, Merck', 'Expert Testimony: AstraZeneca']}, {'Author': 'Thomas George', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Tempus, BillionToOne, Pfizer/Array', 'Research Funding: Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Merck (Inst), AstraZeneca/MedImmune (Inst), Lilly (Inst), Bayer (Inst), Incyte (Inst), Ipsen (Inst), Seagen (Inst), Genentech (Inst), Astellas Pharma (Inst), BioMed Valley Discoveries (Inst), GlaxoSmithKline (Inst), Amgen (Inst), OncoC4 (Inst), BillionToOne (Inst), Jounce Therapeutics (Inst), Elicio Therapeutics (Inst)', 'Open Payments Link: https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/physician/321938']}, {'Author': 'Alan Venook', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Merck Sharp & Dohme, Amgen, GlaxoSmithKline, Exelixis, BridgeBio Pharma, Bayer Health, Gilead Sciences, Exact Sciences, Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation/Janssen, Pfizer', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Royalties from Now-UptoDate for authoring and maintaining two chapters']}, {'Author': 'Jeffrey Farma', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Genmab', 'Expert Testimony: Legal firms']}, {'Author': ""Eileen O'Reilly"", 'Disclosures': ['This author is an Associate Editor for Journal of Clinical Oncology .

Loh,NY; NJ; CA; CA; TN; NJ; MD; NY; AL; OH; Germany; MD; TX; MN; CO; Canada; PA; WA; WA,"Purpose: Blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager immunotherapy, is efficacious in relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL (B-ALL) and has a favorable toxicity profile. One aim of the Children's Oncology Group AALL1331 study was to compare survival of patients with low-risk (LR) first relapse of B-ALL treated with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus blinatumomab.

Patients and Methods: After block 1 reinduction, patients age 1-30 years with LR first relapse of B-ALL were randomly assigned to block 2/block 3/two continuation chemotherapy cycles/maintenance (arm C) or block 2/two cycles of continuation chemotherapy intercalated with three blinatumomab blocks/maintenance (arm D). Patients with CNS leukemia received 18 Gy cranial radiation during maintenance and intensified intrathecal chemotherapy. The primary and secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

Results: The 4-year DFS/OS for the 255 LR patients accrued between December 2014 and September 2019 were 61.2% ± 5.0%/90.4% ± 3.0% for blinatumomab versus 49.5% ± 5.2%/79.6% ± 4.3% for chemotherapy (P = .089/P = .11). For bone marrow (BM) ± extramedullary (EM) (BM ± EM; n = 174) relapses, 4-year DFS/OS were 72.7% ± 5.8%/97.1% ± 2.1% for blinatumomab versus 53.7% ± 6.7%/84.8% ± 4.8% for chemotherapy (P = .015/P = .020). For isolated EM (IEM; n = 81) relapses, 4-year DFS/OS were 36.6% ± 8.2%/76.5% ± 7.5% for blinatumomab versus 38.8% ± 8.0%/68.8% ± 8.6% for chemotherapy (P = .62/P = .53). Blinatumomab was well tolerated and patients had low adverse event rates.

Conclusion: For children, adolescents, and young adults with B-ALL in LR first relapse, there was no statistically significant difference in DFS or OS between the blinatumomab and standard chemotherapy arms overall. However, blinatumomab significantly improved DFS and OS for the two thirds of patients with BM ± EM relapse, establishing a new standard of care for this population. By contrast, similar outcomes and poor DFS for both arms were observed in the one third of patients with IEM; new treatment approaches are needed for these patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02101853).",2023-9-1,JCO.22.02200,"[{'Author': 'Patrick A.

A phase II study of afatinib in EGFR mutation–positive lung adenocarcinoma demonstrated high response rates and progression-free survival (PFS).

Patients and Methods: In this phase III study, eligible patients with stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma were screened for EGFR mutations. Mutation-positive patients were stratified by mutation type (exon 19 deletion, L858R, or other) and race (Asian or non-Asian) before two-to-one random assignment to 40 mg afatinib per day or up to six cycles of cisplatin plus pemetrexed chemotherapy at standard doses every 21 days. The primary end point was PFS by independent review. Secondary end points included tumor response, overall survival, adverse events, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

Results: A total of 1,269 patients were screened, and 345 were randomly assigned to treatment. Median PFS was 11.1 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.78; P = .001). Median PFS among those with exon 19 deletions and L858R EGFR mutations (n = 308) was 13.6 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherapy (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.65; P = .001). The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea, rash/acne, and stomatitis for afatinib and nausea, fatigue, and decreased appetite for chemotherapy. PROs favored afatinib, with better control of cough, dyspnea, and pain.

Conclusion: Afatinib is associated with prolongation of PFS when compared with standard doublet chemotherapy in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutations.",2023-6-1,JCO.22.02547,[]
Impact of 18F-Labeled Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography Versus Conventional Staging in Patients With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer,Ian S.

Levine,Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada,"Purpose: Patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) typically undergo staging tests at presentation. If staging does not detect metastases, treatment consists of curative intent combined modality therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, and regional radiation). Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) may detect more asymptomatic distant metastases, but the evidence is based on uncontrolled studies.

Methods: For inclusion, patients had histological evidence of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and TNM stage III or IIb (T3N0, but not T2N1). Consenting patients from six regional cancer centers in Ontario were randomly assigned to 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT or conventional staging (bone scan, CT of the chest/abdomen and pelvis). The primary end point was upstaging to stage IV. A key secondary outcome was receiving curative intent combined modality therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02751710).

Results: Between December 2016 and April 2022, 184 patients were randomly assigned to whole-body PET-CT and 185 patients to conventional staging. Forty-three (23%) PET-CT patients were upstaged to stage IV compared with 21 (11%) conventional staged patients (absolute difference, 12.3% [95% CI, 3.9 to 19.9]; P = .002). Consequently, treatment was changed in 35 (81.3%) of 43 upstaged PET-CT patients and 20 (95.2%) of the 21 upstaged conventional patients. Subsequently, 149 (81%) patients in the PET-CT group received combined modality treatment versus 165 (89.2%) patients in the conventional staging group (absolute difference, 8.2% [95% CI, 0.1 to 15.4]; P = .03).

Conclusion: In patients with LABC, PET-CT detected more distant metastases than conventional staging, and fewer PET-CT patients received combined modality therapy.

Previous studies in these patients have shown improvements in various microbiome indices after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). However, whether microbiome improvements translate into improved clinical outcomes remains unclear. We examined this question in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial.

Methods: Two independent cohorts of allogeneic HCT recipients and patients with AML receiving induction chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive standardized oral encapsulated FMT versus placebo upon neutrophil recovery. After each course of antibacterial antibiotics, patients received a study treatment. Up to three treatments were administered within 3 months. The primary end point was 4-month all-cause infection rate. Patients were followed for 9 months.

Results: In the HCT cohort (74 patients), 4-month infection density was 0.74 and 0.91 events per 100 patient-days in FMT and placebo arms, respectively (infection rate ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.42; P = .49). In the AML cohort (26 patients), 4-month infection density was 0.93 in the FMT arm and 1.25 in the placebo arm, with an infection rate ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.32 to 1.71; P = .48). Unique donor bacterial sequences comprised 25%-30% of the fecal microbiota after FMT. FMT improved postantibiotic recovery of microbiota diversity, restored several depleted obligate anaerobic commensals, and reduced the abundance of expanded genera Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Dialister.

Conclusion: In allogeneic HCT recipients and patients with AML, third-party FMT was safe and ameliorated intestinal dysbiosis, but did not decrease infections.

PFS was the primary end point, defined as time from random assignment to disease progression or death. Assuming a median PFS of 3.8 months with placebo, we had 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (corresponding to a median PFS of at least 6.5 months with ribociclib) with 120 patients randomly assigned using a one-sided log-rank test and significance level set at 2.5%.

Results: Of the 119 randomly assigned participants, 103 (86.5%) previously received palbociclib and 14 participants received ribociclib (11.7%). There was a statistically significant PFS improvement for patients randomly assigned to switched ET plus ribociclib (median, 5.29 months; 95% CI, 3.02 to 8.12 months) versus switched ET plus placebo (median, 2.76 months; 95% CI, 2.66 to 3.25 months) HR, 0.57 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.85); P = .006. At 6 and 12 months, the PFS rate was 41.2% and 24.6% with ribociclib, respectively, compared with 23.9% and 7.4% with placebo.

Conclusion: In this randomized trial, there was a significant PFS benefit for patients with HR+/HER2– MBC who switched ET and received ribociclib compared with placebo after previous CDK4/6i and different ET.",2023-8-20,JCO.22.02392,[]
Prospective Randomized Trial of Docetaxel Versus Best Supportive Care in Patients With Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With Platinum-Based Chemotherapy,Frances A.  Shepherd; Janet  Dancey; Rodryg  Ramlau; Karin  Mattson; Richard  Gralla; Mark  O’Rourke; Nathan  Levitan; Laurent  Gressot; Mark  Vincent; Ronald  Burkes; Susan  Coughlin; Yong  Kim; Jocelyne  Berille,France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.,"Purpose: To evaluate whether treatment with single-agent docetaxel would result in longer survival than would best supportive care in patients with non–small-cell lung cancer who had previously been treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Secondary end points included assessment of response (docetaxel arm only), toxicity, and quality of life.

Results: One hundred four patients (103 of whom were eligible for entry onto the study) were well balanced for prognostic factors. Of 84 patients with measurable lesions, six (7.1%) achieved partial responses (three patients at each dose level). Time to progression was longer for docetaxel patients than for best supportive care patients (10.6 v 6.7 weeks, respectively; P < .001), as was median survival (7.0 v 4.6 months; log-rank test, P = .047). The difference was more significant for docetaxel 75 mg/m2 patients, compared with corresponding best supportive care patients (7.5 v 4.6 months; log-rank test, P = .010; 1-year survival, 37% v 11%; χ2 test, P = .003). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 11 patients treated with docetaxel 100 mg/m2, three of whom died, and in one patient treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2. Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, with the exception of diarrhea, occurred at a similar rate in both the docetaxel and best supportive care groups.

Conclusion: Treatment with docetaxel is associated with significant prolongation of survival, and at a dose of 75 mg/m2, the benefits of docetaxel therapy outweigh the risks.",2023-5-20,JCO.22.02545,[]

Patients and Methods: Eligible patients had a performance status 0 to 2, previous treatment with one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced NSCLC, and adequate organ function. Patients received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1 with vitamin B12, folic acid, and dexamethasone or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV day 1 with dexamethasone every 21 days. The primary end point was overall survival.

Results: Five hundred seventy-one patients were randomly assigned. Overall response rates were 9.1% and 8.8% (analysis of variance P = .105) for pemetrexed and docetaxel, respectively. Median progression-free survival was 2.9 months for each arm, and median survival time was 8.3 versus 7.9 months (P = not significant) for pemetrexed and docetaxel, respectively. The 1-year survival rate for each arm was 29.7%. Patients receiving docetaxel were more likely to have grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (40.2% v 5.3%; P < .001), febrile neutropenia (12.7% v 1.9%; P < .001), neutropenia with infections (3.3% v 0.0%; P = .004), hospitalizations for neutropenic fever (13.4% v 1.5%; P < .001), hospitalizations due to other drug related adverse events (10.5% v 6.4%; P = .092), use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support (19.2% v 2.6%, P < .001) and all grade alopecia (37.7% v 6.4%; P < .001) compared with patients receiving pemetrexed.

Conclusion: Treatment with pemetrexed resulted in clinically equivalent efficacy outcomes, but with significantly fewer side effects compared with docetaxel in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC and should be considered a standard treatment option for second-line NSCLC when available.",2023-5-20,JCO.22.02546,[]

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

In a randomized phase II clinical trial, the Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group compared single- versus multifraction stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) in 90 patients with 133 oligometastases to the lung. The study found no differences in safety, efficacy, systemic immunogenicity, or survival between arms, with single-fraction SABR picked as the winner on the basis of cost-effectiveness. In this article, we report the final updated survival outcome analysis. The protocol mandated no concurrent or post-therapy systemic therapy until progression. Modified disease-free survival (mDFS) was defined as any progression not addressable by local therapy, or death. At a median follow-up of 5.4 years, the 3- and 5-year estimates for overall survival (OS) were 70% (95% CI, 59 to 78) and 51% (95% CI, 39 to 61). There were no significant differences between the multi- and single-fraction arms for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.1 [95% CI, 0.6 to 2.0]; P = .81). The 3- and 5-year estimates for disease-free survival were 24% (95% CI, 16 to 33) and 20% (95% CI, 13 to 29), with no differences between arms (HR, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.6]; P = .92). The 3- and 5-year estimates for mDFS were 39% (95% CI, 29 to 49) and 34% (95% CI, 24 to 44), with no differences between arms (HR, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.8]; P = .90).

Phase II studies of pemetrexed plus platinum compounds have also shown activity in this setting.

Patients and Methods: This noninferiority, phase III, randomized study compared the overall survival between treatment arms using a fixed margin method (hazard ratio [HR] < 1.176) in 1,725 chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. Patients received cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 and gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 (n = 863) or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 on day 1 (n = 862) every 3 weeks for up to six cycles.

Results: Overall survival for cisplatin/pemetrexed was noninferior to cisplatin/gemcitabine (median survival, 10.3 v 10.3 months, respectively; HR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.05). Overall survival was statistically superior for cisplatin/pemetrexed versus cisplatin/gemcitabine in patients with adenocarcinoma (n = 847; 12.6 v 10.9 months, respectively) and large-cell carcinoma histology (n = 153; 10.4 v 6.7 months, respectively). In contrast, in patients with squamous cell histology, there was a significant improvement in survival with cisplatin/gemcitabine versus cisplatin/pemetrexed (n = 473; 10.8 v 9.4 months, respectively). For cisplatin/pemetrexed, rates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia (P ≤ .001); febrile neutropenia (P = .002); and alopecia (P < .001) were significantly lower, whereas grade 3 or 4 nausea (P = .004) was more common.

Conclusion: In advanced NSCLC, cisplatin/pemetrexed provides similar efficacy with better tolerability and more convenient administration than cisplatin/gemcitabine. This is the first prospective phase III study in NSCLC to show survival differences based on histologic type.",2023-5-10,JCO.22.02544,[]

Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed using flow cytometry (FCM), and the impact of early intensification and methotrexate (MTX) dose on survival was evaluated.

Patients and Methods: We included 6,187 patients younger than 19 years. MRD by FCM refined the risk group definition previously used in the ALL intercontinental-BFM 2002 study on the basis of age, WBC count, unfavorable genetic aberrations, and treatment response measured morphologically. Patients at intermediate risk (IR) and high risk (HR) were randomly assigned to protocol augmented protocol I phase B (IB) versus IB regimen. MTX doses of 2 versus 5 g/m2 every 2 weeks, four times, were evaluated in precursor B-cell-ALL (pcB-ALL) IR.

Results: The 5-year event-free survival (EFS ± SE) and overall survival (OS ± SE) rates were 75.2% ± 0.6% and 82.6% ± 0.5%, respectively. Their values in risk groups were standard risk (n = 624), 90.7% ± 1.4% and 94.7% ± 1.1%; IR (n = 4,111), 77.9% ± 0.7% and 85.7% ± 0.6%; and HR (n = 1,452), 60.8% ± 1.5% and 68.4% ± 1.4%, respectively.

Patients and Methods: In a phase II trial, 99 patients were randomly assigned to bevacizumab 7.5 (n = 32) or 15 mg/kg (n = 35) plus carboplatin (area under the curve = 6) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) every 3 weeks or carboplatin and paclitaxel alone (n = 32). Primary efficacy end points were time to disease progression and best confirmed response rate. On disease progression, patients in the control arm had the option to receive single-agent bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

Results: Compared with the control arm, treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) resulted in a higher response rate (31.5% v 18.8%), longer median time to progression (7.4 v 4.2 months) and a modest increase in survival (17.7 v 14.9 months). Of the 19 control patients that crossed over to single-agent bevacizumab, five experienced stable disease, and 1-year survival was 47%. Bleeding was the most prominent adverse event and was manifested in two distinct clinical patterns; minor mucocutaneous hemorrhage and major hemoptysis. Major hemoptysis was associated with squamous cell histology, tumor necrosis and cavitation, and disease location close to major blood vessels.

Conclusion: Bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel improved overall response and time to progression in patients with advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer.

Figg; Chris  William-Hughes; Sandy  Kessel; Maryam  Fouladi; Amar  Gajjar; Daniel  Bowers,MA; DC; CA; CA; CA; MD; MD; CA; RI; OH; TN; TX,"Purpose: Children with low-grade glioma often require long-term therapy and suffer from treatment morbidity. Although targeted agents are promising, tumor targets often encompass normal developmental pathways and long-term effects of inhibition are unknown. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with wide-ranging properties. Phase I studies indicated greater tolerability of lenalidomide in children compared with adults and a potential dose-response effect.

Patients and Methods: We performed a phase II trial of lenalidomide in children with pilocytic astrocytomas and optic pathway gliomas who failed initial therapy. Primary objectives included determination of objective response rate of children randomly assigned to regimen A, low-dose (20 mg/m2/dose), or regimen B, high-dose (115 mg/m2/dose) lenalidomide, and assessment for early progression. Secondary objectives included estimation of event-free survival, overall survival, incidence of toxic events, and assessment of plasma lenalidomide concentrations. Lenalidomide was administered once daily × 21 days of each 28-day cycle for each regimen.

Results: Seventy-four eligible patients were enrolled (n = 37, each arm). The predefined activity level of interest was achieved for both arms. Four objective responses were observed in each arm, and the number of early progressors was low. Eighteen patients completed 26 cycles of therapy (regimen A, n = 12; regimen B, n = 6). The median number of cycles was 14 (range, 2-26) for regimen A and 11 for regimen B (range, 1-26). Of 74 eligible patients who received study drug, 30 required dose reduction for toxicity (regimen A, n = 6; regimen B, n = 24) and 16 discontinued because of toxicity (regimen A, n = 2; regimen B, n = 14).

Conclusion: Lenalidomide demonstrates a sufficient level of activity in children with low-grade glioma to warrant further exploration. Low-dose (20 mg/m2/dose administered once daily × 21 days of each 28-day cycle) lenalidomide appears to have better tolerability with comparable activity.",2023-6-20,JCO.22.01777,"[{'Author': 'Katherine E.

In high-risk PV, ruxolitinib controls blood counts and improves symptoms.

Patients and Methods: MAJIC-PV is a randomized phase II trial of ruxolitinib versus best available therapy (BAT) in patients resistant/intolerant to hydroxycarbamide (HC-INT/RES). Primary outcome was complete response (CR) within 1 year. Secondary outcomes included duration of response, event-free survival (EFS), symptom, and molecular response.

Results: One hundred eighty patients were randomly assigned. CR was achieved in 40 (43%) patients on ruxolitinib versus 23 (26%) on BAT (odds ratio, 2.12; 90% CI, 1.25 to 3.60; P = .02). Duration of CR was superior for ruxolitinib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.61; P < .001). Symptom responses were better with ruxolitinib and durable. EFS (major thrombosis, hemorrhage, transformation, and death) was superior for patients attaining CR within 1 year (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.78; P = .01); and those on ruxolitinib (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.94; P = .03). Serial analysis of JAK2V617F variant allele fraction revealed molecular response was more frequent with ruxolitinib and was associated with improved outcomes (progression-free survival [PFS] P = .001, EFS P = .001, overall survival P = .01) and clearance of JAK2V617F stem/progenitor cells. ASXL1 mutations predicted for adverse EFS (HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.47 to 6.17; P = .003). The safety profile of ruxolitinib was as previously reported.

Methods: Patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer were randomly assigned to dose-escalated RT alone (arm 1) or RT plus TAS (arm 2) consisting of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist/antagonist with oral antiandrogen for 6 months. The primary PRO was the validated Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-50). Secondary PROs included Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-fatigue and EuroQOL five-dimensions scale questionnaire (EQ-5D). PRO change scores, calculated for each patient as the follow-up score minus baseline score (at the end of RT and at 6, 12, and 60 months), were compared between treatment arms using a two-sample t test. An effect size of 0.50 standard deviation was considered clinically meaningful.

Results: For the primary PRO instrument (EPIC), the completion rates were ≥86% through the first year of follow-up and 70%-75% at 5 years. For the EPIC hormonal and sexual domains, there were clinically meaningful (P < .0001) deficits in the RT + TAS arm. However, there were no clinically meaningful differences by 1 year between arms. There were also no clinically meaningful differences at any time points between arms for PROMIS-fatigue, EQ-5D, and EPIC bowel/urinary scores.

Conclusion: Compared with dose-escalated RT alone, adding TAS demonstrated clinically meaningful declines only in EPIC hormonal and sexual domains. However, even these PRO differences were transient, and there were no clinically meaningful differences between arms by 1 year.",2023-6-10,JCO.22.02389,"[{'Author': 'Benjamin Movsas', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Varian Medical Systems (Inst), Philips Healthcare (Inst), ViewRay (Inst)', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Lung phantom for image guidance, MR-CT imaging related patent for radiation oncology', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Varian Medical Systems, ViewRay, Alpha Tau']}, {'Author': 'Gerard C.

We investigated the effects of extending this treatment to 10 years on disease-free survival (DFS).

Patients and Methods: This prospective, randomized, multicenter open-label phase III study assessed the effect of extending anastrozole treatment for an additional 5 years in postmenopausal patients who were disease-free after treatment with either 5 years of anastrozole alone or 2-3 years of tamoxifen followed by 2-3 years of anastrozole. Patients were allocated randomly (1:1) to continue anastrozole for an additional 5 years or stop anastrozole. The primary end point was DFS, including breast cancer recurrence, second primary cancers, and death from any cause. This study is registered with University Hospital Medical Information Network, Japan (UMIN) clinical trials registry (UMIN000000818).

Results: We enrolled 1,697 patients from 117 facilities between November 2007 and November 2012. Follow-up information was available for 1,593 patients (n = 787 in the continue group, n = 806 in the stop group), who were defined as the full analysis set, including 144 patients previously treated with tamoxifen and 259 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery without irradiation. The 5-year DFS rates were 91% (95% CI, 89 to 93) in the continue group and 86% (95% CI, 83 to 88) in the stop group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.82; P < .0010). Notably, extended anastrozole treatment reduced the incidence of local recurrence (continue group, n = 10; stop group, n = 27) and second primary cancers (continue group, n = 27; stop group, n = 52). There was no significant difference in overall or distant DFS. Menopausal or bone-related all-grade adverse events were more frequent among patients in the continue group than those in the stop group, but the incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events was <1% in both groups.

Conclusion: Continuing adjuvant anastrozole for an additional 5 years after 5 years of initial treatment with anastrozole or tamoxifen followed by anastrozole was well tolerated and improved DFS. Although no difference in overall survival was observed as in other trials, extended anastrozole therapy could be one treatment choice in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer.",2023-6-20,JCO.22.00577,"[{'Author': 'Shigehira Saji', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Chugai Pharma, Eisai, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Novartis, Pfizer, Kyowa Kirin, Daiichi Sankyo, AstraZeneca, Lilly, MSD, Ono Pharmaceutical, Takeda, Exact Sciences', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Kyowa Kirin, Chugai Pharma, Roche/Genentech, Daiichi Sankyo/UCB Japan, MSD', 'Research Funding: Chugai Pharma (Inst), Taiho Pharmaceutical (Inst), Daiichi Sankyo/UCB Japan (Inst), MSD (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Sanofi (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Shoichiro Ohtani', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Chugai Pharma, Pfizer, Eisai, Lilly']}, {'Author': 'Yasuo Hozumi', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Chugai Pharma, Pfizer, Lilly']}, {'Author': 'Hiroyuki Takei', 'Disclosures': [""Speakers' Bureau: Pfizer, Lilly Japan, Kyowa Kirin International, Chugai Pharma, Eisai"", 'Research Funding: Chugai Pharma (Inst), Taiho Pharmaceutical (Inst), Daiichi Sankyo/UCB Japan (Inst), Eisai (Inst), Takeda (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Toshitaka Nakamura', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Asahi Pharma']}, {'Author': 'Hirofumi Mukai', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Daiichi Sankyo, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Takeda', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned coprimary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

Initial results from the phase III JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02603432) showed that avelumab first-line (1L) maintenance plus best supportive care (BSC) significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) versus BSC alone in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC) who were progression-free after 1L platinum-containing chemotherapy. Avelumab 1L maintenance treatment is now a standard of care for aUC. Here, we report updated data with ≥ 2 years of follow-up in all patients, including OS (primary end point), PFS, safety, and additional novel analyses. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive avelumab plus BSC (n = 350) or BSC alone (n = 350). At data cutoff (June 4, 2021), median follow-up was 38.0 months and 39.6 months, respectively; 67 patients (19.5%) had received ≥2 years of avelumab treatment. OS remained longer with avelumab plus BSC versus BSC alone in all patients (hazard ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.91]; 2-sided P = .0036). Investigator-assessed PFS analyses also favored avelumab. Longer-term safety was consistent with previous analyses; no new safety signals were identified with longer treatment duration. In conclusion, longer-term follow-up continues to show clinically meaningful efficacy benefits with avelumab 1L maintenance plus BSC versus BSC alone in patients with aUC.

Prolonged rituximab maintenance did not prolong TTNT, whereas it raises concerns about resources use and patient adhesion. Our aim was then to investigate the use of short rituximab maintenance using the subcutaneous (SC) route in patients with low–tumor burden FL.

Methods: Patients with histologically confirmed CD20+ low–tumor burden FL were randomly assigned to receive either rituximab, 375 mg/m2 once daily on D1, D8, D15, and D22, intravenous route (IV, control arm), or rituximab, 375 mg/m2, on day 1 (D1), IV followed by rituximab 1,400 mg total dose, SC once daily on D8, D15, and D22, with maintenance at months 3 (M3), M5, M7, and M9 (experimental arm). The primary end point was PFS. Secondary end points included safety, overall response rates, TTNT, and overall survival (OS).

Results: Two hundred two patients with low–tumor burden FL were randomly assigned to the experimental (n = 100) or control arm (n = 102). The primary end point was met: the 4-year PFS was 58.1% (95% CI, 47.5 to 67.4) and 41.2% (95% CI, 30.6 to 51.6) in experimental and control arms, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.585 [0.393 to 0.871]; P = .0076). Complete response (CR) rates were 59.0% (95% CI, 48.7 to 68.7) in the experimental arm and 36.3% (95% CI, 27.0 to 46.4) in the control arm (P = .001). TTNT and OS were not significantly different. CR was associated with longer PFS and TTNT. High rituximab exposure during the first three months was independently associated with higher CR, PFS, and TTNT.

Conclusion: SC rituximab improves PFS for patients with low–tumor burden FL when used in induction followed by short maintenance. High rituximab exposure during the first 3 months after treatment initiation is, however, the only parameter influencing patient outcomes.",2023-7-1,JCO.22.02327,"[{'Author': 'Guillaume Cartron', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Gilead Sciences, Janssen, Roche, AbbVie, Novartis, BMS', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, MAbQi, MedXCell, BMS', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche, Gilead Sciences']}, {'Author': 'Emmanuel Bachy', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Gilead Sciences, Roche, Amgen, Janssen-Cilag, Novartis, Takeda, Incyte', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Gilead Sciences, Incyte, Takeda, Novartis', 'Research Funding: Amgen Foundation (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen-Cilag, Roche, Gilead Sciences, Incyte']}, {'Author': 'Hervé Tilly', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Incyte, Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb, ADC Therapeutics', 'Research Funding: Roche/Genentech (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen, Gilead Sciences']}, {'Author': 'Aline Clavert', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AbbVie, Janssen Oncology, AstraZeneca/MedImmune']}, {'Author': 'Gandhi Laurent Damaj', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Takeda, Amgen, Blueprint Medicines, Novartis, BMS', ""Speakers' Bureau: AbbVie"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer, AbbVie, Takeda']}, {'Author': 'Olivier Casasnovas', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche/Genentech, Takeda, Gilead Sciences, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, AbbVie, Celgene, Janssen, Amgen', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche/Genentech, Takeda, Gilead Sciences, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, AbbVie, Celgene, Janssen, Incyte, ADC Therapeutics', 'Research Funding: Roche/Genentech (Inst), Gilead Sciences (Inst), Takeda (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche/Genentech, Takeda, Gilead Sciences, Janssen, AbbVie']}, {'Author': 'Roch Houot', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: MSD, Kite/Gilead, Roche, Novartis, Janssen, Incyte, Takeda', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Kite/Gilead, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene, ADC Therapeutics, Incyte, Miltenyi Biomedicine']}, {'Author': 'Kamal Bouabdallah', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche, Takeda Science Foundation, AbbVie, Kite/Gilead, Sandoz-Novartis, BeiGene', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Takeda, Kite/Gilead', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche, Takeda, Kite/Gilead']}, {'Author': 'David Sibon', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Takeda, Janssen, Roche, AbbVie', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Takeda, Janssen']}, {'Author': 'Charles Herbaux', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche, Janssen-Cilag, AbbVie, Gilead Sciences', 'Research Funding: Takeda (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen-Cilag, AbbVie, Roche']}, {'Author': 'Thomas Gastinne', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Kite, a Gilead company, Takeda, BMS, Novartis', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Takeda, Kite, a Gilead Company']}, {'Author': 'Luc-Matthieu Fornecker', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Takeda, Roche', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Takeda, Roche']}, {'Author': 'Corinne Haioun', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche, Janssen-Cilag, Gilead Sciences, Miltenyi Biotec, Amgen, Takeda, Celgene']}, {'Author': 'Remy Gressin', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Celgene', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer, Sandoz, Celgene']}, {'Author': 'Franck Morschhauser', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche/Genentech, Chugai/Roche, Eisai', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche/Genentech, Gilead Sciences, Bristol Myers Squibb, AbbVie, Epizyme, Servier, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Genmab']}, {'Author': 'David Ternant', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, Boehringer Ingelheim France, Lundbeck', ""Speakers' Bureau: AstraZeneca, Amgen""]}, {'Author': 'Luc Xerri', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: EUSA Pharma']}, {'Author': 'Karin Tarte', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Bristol Myers Squibb', 'Research Funding: Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene (Inst), Roche (Inst), Epizyme (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Kite/Gilead, Roche', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"
Phase III Study of Pemetrexed in Combination With Cisplatin Versus Cisplatin Alone in Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma,Nicholas J. Vogelzang; James J.

Kaukel; Pierre Ruffie; Ulrich Gatzemeier; Michael Boyer; Salih Emri; Christian Manegold; Clet Niyikiza; Paolo Paoletti,Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.,"Purpose: Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, a rapidly progressing malignancy with a median survival time of 6 to 9 months, have previously responded poorly to chemotherapy. We conducted a phase III trial to determine whether treatment with pemetrexed and cisplatin results in survival time superior to that achieved with cisplatin alone.

Patients and Methods: Chemotherapy-naive patients who were not eligible for curative surgery were randomly assigned to receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1, or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1. Both regimens were given intravenously every 21 days.

Results: A total of 456 patients were assigned: 226 received pemetrexed and cisplatin, 222 received cisplatin alone, and eight never received therapy. Median survival time in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm was 12.1 months versus 9.3 months in the control arm (P = .020, two-sided log-rank test). The hazard ratio for death of patients in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm versus those in the control arm was 0.77. Median time to progression was significantly longer in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm: 5.7 months versus 3.9 months (P = .001). Response rates were 41.3% in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm versus 16.7% in the control arm (P < .0001). After 117 patients had enrolled, folic acid and vitamin B12 were added to reduce toxicity, resulting in a significant reduction in toxicities in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm.

Conclusion: Treatment with pemetrexed plus cisplatin and vitamin supplementation resulted in superior survival time, time to progression, and response rates compared with treatment with cisplatin alone in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Addition of folic acid and vitamin B12 significantly reduced toxicity without adversely affecting survival time.",2023-4-20,JCO.22.02542,[]

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

We report the final prespecified analysis for overall survival (OS), along with updated progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR), and safety from the open-label, randomized, phase III Study 309/KEYNOTE-775. In total, 827 patients with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic endometrial cancer (EC) were randomly assigned to receive lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily plus pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks (n = 411) or chemotherapy of the treating physician's choice (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 intravenously once every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenously once weekly [3 weeks on; 1 week off] [n = 416]). Efficacy was reported for patients with mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) tumors and all-comers, and by subgroups (histology, prior therapy, MMR status). Updated safety was also reported.

Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab showed benefits in OS (pMMR HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.83; all-comer HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.77), PFS (pMMR HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.72; all-comer HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.66), and ORR (pMMR patients, 32.4% v 15.1%; all-comers, 33.8% v 14.7%) versus chemotherapy. OS, PFS, and ORR favored lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in all subgroups of interest. No new safety signals were observed.

Local anesthesia blocks voltage-gated sodium channels and thereby prevents activation of prometastatic pathways. We conducted an open-label, multicenter randomized trial to test the impact of presurgical, peritumoral infiltration of local anesthesia on disease-free survival (DFS).

Methods: Women with early breast cancer planned for upfront surgery without prior neoadjuvant treatment were randomly assigned to receive peritumoral injection of 0.5% lidocaine, 7-10 minutes before surgery (local anesthetics [LA] arm) or surgery without lidocaine (no LA arm). Random assignment was stratified by menopausal status, tumor size, and center. Participants received standard postoperative adjuvant treatment. Primary and secondary end points were DFS and overall survival (OS), respectively.

Results: Excluding eligibility violations, 1,583 of 1,600 randomly assigned patients were included in this analysis (LA, 796; no LA, 804). At a median follow-up of 68 months, there were 255 DFS events (LA, 109; no LA, 146) and 189 deaths (LA, 79; no LA, 110). In LA and no LA arms, 5-year DFS rates were 86.6% and 82.6% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.95; P = .017) and 5-year OS rates were 90.1% and 86.4%, respectively (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.94; P = .019). The impact of LA was similar in subgroups defined by menopausal status, tumor size, nodal metastases, and hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. Using competing risk analyses, in LA and no LA arms, 5-year cumulative incidence rates of locoregional recurrence were 3.4% and 4.5% (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.11), and distant recurrence rates were 8.5% and 11.6%, respectively (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.99). There were no adverse events because of lidocaine injection.

Conclusion: Peritumoral injection of lidocaine before breast cancer surgery significantly increases DFS and OS. Altering events at the time of surgery can prevent metastases in early breast cancer (CTRI/2014/11/005228).",2023-6-20,JCO.22.01966,"[{'Author': 'Sudeep Gupta', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Roche (Inst), Sanofi (Inst), Johnson & Johnson (Inst), Amgen (Inst), Celltrion (Inst), Oncostem Diagnostics (Inst), Novartis (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Intas (Inst)', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

Hawkins,NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.; NC.,"Purpose: Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-Kit. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study evaluated efficacy and safety of pazopanib monotherapy in treatment-naive and cytokine-pretreated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Patients and Methods: Adult patients with measurable, locally advanced, and/or metastatic RCC were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive oral pazopanib or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival, tumor response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), and safety. Radiographic assessments of tumors were independently reviewed.

Results: Of 435 patients enrolled, 233 were treatment naive (54%) and 202 were cytokine pretreated (46%). PFS was significantly prolonged with pazopanib compared with placebo in the overall study population (median, PFS 9.2 v 4.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.62; P < .0001), the treatment-naive subpopulation (median PFS 11.1 v 2.8 months; HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.60; P < .0001), and the cytokine-pretreated subpopulation (median PFS, 7.4 v 4.2 months; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.84; P < .001). The objective response rate was 30% with pazopanib compared with 3% with placebo (P < .001). The median duration of response was longer than 1 year. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, hypertension, hair color changes, nausea, anorexia, and vomiting. There was no evidence of clinically important differences in quality of life for pazopanib versus placebo.

Conclusion: Pazopanib demonstrated significant improvement in PFS and tumor response compared with placebo in treatment-naive and cytokine-pretreated patients with advanced and/or metastatic RCC.",2023-4-10,JCO.22.02622,[]

Final survival analyses and updated results are reported.

Patients and Methods: Seven hundred fifty treatment-naïve patients with metastatic clear cell RCC were randomly assigned to sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily on a 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off dosing schedule or to IFN-α 9 MU subcutaneously thrice weekly. Overall survival was compared by two-sided log-rank and Wilcoxon tests. Progression-free survival, response, and safety end points were assessed with updated follow-up.

Results: Median overall survival was greater in the sunitinib group than in the IFN-α group (26.4 v 21.8 months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.821; 95% CI, 0.673 to 1.001; P = .051) per the primary analysis of unstratified log-rank test (P = .013 per unstratified Wilcoxon test). By stratified log-rank test, the HR was 0.818 (95% CI, 0.669 to 0.999; P = .049). Within the IFN-α group, 33% of patients received sunitinib, and 32% received other vascular endothelial growth factor–signaling inhibitors after discontinuation from the trial. Median progression-free survival was 11 months for sunitinib compared with 5 months for IFN-α (P < .001). Objective response rate was 47% for sunitinib compared with 12% for IFN-α (P < .001). The most commonly reported sunitinib-related grade 3 adverse events included hypertension (12%), fatigue (11%), diarrhea (9%), and hand-foot syndrome (9%).

Conclusion: Sunitinib demonstrates longer overall survival compared with IFN-α plus improvement in response and progression-free survival in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic RCC. The overall survival highlights an improved prognosis in patients with RCC in the era of targeted therapy.",2023-4-10,JCO.22.02623,[]
Endosonography With or Without Confirmatory Mediastinoscopy for Resectable Lung Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial,Jelle E.  Bousema; Marcel G.W.  Dijkgraaf; Erik H.F.M.  van der Heijden; Ad F.T.M.  Verhagen; Jouke T.  Annema; Frank J.C.  van den Broek; on behalf of the MEDIASTrial study group,the Netherlands; the Netherlands; the Netherlands; the Netherlands; the Netherlands; the Netherlands,"Purpose: Resectable non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a high probability of mediastinal nodal involvement requires mediastinal staging by endosonography and, in the absence of nodal metastases, confirmatory mediastinoscopy according to current guidelines. However, randomized data regarding immediate lung tumor resection after systematic endosonography versus additional confirmatory mediastinoscopy before resection are lacking.

Methods: Patients with (suspected) resectable NSCLC and an indication for mediastinal staging after negative systematic endosonography were randomly assigned to immediate lung tumor resection or confirmatory mediastinoscopy followed by tumor resection. The primary outcome in this noninferiority trial (noninferiority margin of 8% that previously showed to not compromise survival, Pnoninferior < .0250) was the presence of unforeseen N2 disease after tumor resection with lymph node dissection. Secondary outcomes were 30-day major morbidity and mortality.

Results: Between July 17, 2017, and October 5, 2020, 360 patients were randomly assigned, 178 to immediate lung tumor resection (seven dropouts) and 182 to confirmatory mediastinoscopy first (seven dropouts before and six after mediastinoscopy). Mediastinoscopy detected metastases in 8.0% (14/175; 95% CI, 4.8 to 13.0) of patients. Unforeseen N2 rate after immediate resection (8.8%) was noninferior compared with mediastinoscopy first (7.7%) in both intention-to-treat (Δ, 1.03%; UL 95% CIΔ, 7.2%; Pnoninferior = .0144) and per-protocol analyses (Δ, 0.83%; UL 95% CIΔ, 7.3%; Pnoninferior = .0157). Major morbidity and 30-day mortality was 12.9% after immediate resection versus 15.4% after mediastinoscopy first (P = .4940).

Conclusion: On the basis of our chosen noninferiority margin in the rate of unforeseen N2, confirmatory mediastinoscopy after negative systematic endosonography can be omitted in patients with resectable NSCLC and an indication for mediastinal staging.",2023-8-1,JCO.22.01728,"[{'Author': 'Erik H.F.M. van der Heijden', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Pentax Medical Devices (Inst), Siemens Healthineers (Inst), Janssen Oncology (Inst)', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (Inst), Intuitive Surgical (Inst)', 'Research Funding: AstraZeneca (Inst), Philips Research (Inst), Pentax Medical Devices (Inst), Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (Inst)', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Patents issued, pending and planned in the field of advanced and navigation bronchoscopy (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Jouke T.

Methods: CMSs were determined in the safety set (ie, patients that received induction) and full analysis set (FAS; ie, randomly assigned patients who received maintenance) and correlated with median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) since the start of induction or maintenance treatment and objective response rates (ORRs). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI were calculated by univariate/multivariate Cox regression analyses.

Results: Of 377 patients of the safety set, 296 (78.5%) had available CMS data: CMS1/2/3/4: 29 (9.8%)/122 (41.2%)/33 (11.2%)/112 (37.8%) and unclassifiable: 17 (5.7%). The CMSs were prognostic biomarkers in terms of PFS (P < .0001), OS (P < .0001), and ORR (P = .02) since the start of induction treatment. In FAS patients (n = 196), with CMS2/4 tumors, the addition of Pmab to FU/FA maintenance therapy was associated with longer PFS (CMS2: HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.95], P = .03; CMS4: HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.38 to 1.03], P = .07) and OS (CMS2: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.52 to 1.52], P = .66; CMS4: HR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.30 to 0.96], P = .04).

Small,NY; NY; MN; MN; MN; MN; AZ; IL; MA; NC; NY; NH; PA; MD; CA; MO; CA; MO; NY; IL; MA; NC; CA,"Purpose: Enzalutamide and abiraterone both target androgen receptor signaling but via different mechanisms. The mechanism of action of one drug may counteract the resistance pathways of the other. We sought to determine whether the addition of abiraterone acetate and prednisone (AAP) to enzalutamide prolongs overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the first-line setting.

Patients and Methods: Men with untreated mCRPC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive first-line enzalutamide with or without AAP. The primary end point was OS. Toxicity, prostate-specific antigen declines, pharmacokinetics, and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) were also examined. Data were analyzed using an intent-to-treat approach. The Kaplan-Meier estimate and the stratified log-rank statistic were used to compare OS between treatments.

Results: In total, 1,311 patients were randomly assigned: 657 to enzalutamide and 654 to enzalutamide plus AAP. OS was not statistically different between the two arms (median, 32.7 [95% CI, 30.5 to 35.4] months for enzalutamide v 34.2 [95% CI, 31.4 to 37.3] months for enzalutamide and AAP; hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; one-sided P = .03; boundary nominal significance level = .02). rPFS was longer in the combination arm (median rPFS, 21.3 [95% CI, 19.4 to 22.9] months for enzalutamide v 24.3 [95% CI, 22.3 to 26.7] months for enzalutamide and AAP; HR, 0.86; two-sided P = .02). However, pharmacokinetic clearance of abiraterone was 2.2- to 2.9-fold higher when administered with enzalutamide, compared with clearance values for abiraterone alone.

Conclusion: The addition of AAP to enzalutamide for first-line treatment of mCRPC was not associated with a statistically significant benefit in OS. Drug-drug interactions between the two agents resulting in increased abiraterone clearance may partly account for this result, although these interactions did not prevent the combination regimen from having more nonhematologic toxicity.",2023-6-20,JCO.22.02394,"[{'Author': 'Michael J.

This phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of sugemalimab, an anti–PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, in R/R ENKTL.

Methods: Eligible patients received sugemalimab 1,200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for up to 24 months or until progression, death, or study withdrawal. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by an independent radiologic review committee. Key secondary end points included ORR assessed by the investigators, complete response rate, duration of response, and safety.

Results: At the data cutoff (February 23, 2022), 80 patients were enrolled and followed for a median of 18.7 months. At baseline, 54 (67.5%) had stage IV disease and 39 (48.8%) had received ≥2 lines of prior systemic therapy. Independent radiologic review committee–assessed ORR was 44.9% (95% CI, 33.6 to 56.6); 28 (35.9%) patients achieved a complete response and seven (9.0%) achieved a partial response, with a 12-month duration of response rate of 82.5% (95% CI, 62.0 to 92.6). Investigator-assessed ORR was 45.6% (95% CI, 34.3 to 57.2), and 24 (30.4%) patients achieved a complete response. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were grade 1-2 in severity, and grade ≥ 3 events were reported in 32 (40.0%) patients.

Conclusion: Sugemalimab showed robust and durable antitumor activity in R/R ENKTL.

Patients and Methods: Women (1,523) enrolled onto National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-18 were randomly assigned to preoperative or postoperative AC therapy. Clinical tumor response to preoperative therapy was graded as complete (cCR), partial (cPR), or no response (cNR). Tumors with a cCR were further categorized as either pathologic complete response (pCR) or invasive cells (pINV). Disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and survival were estimated through 5 years and compared between treatment groups. In the preoperative arm, proportional-hazards models were used to investigate the relationship between outcome and tumor response.

Results: There was no significant difference in DFS, DDFS, or survival (P = .99, .70, and .83, respectively) among patients in either group. More patients treated preoperatively than postoperatively underwent lumpectomy and radiation therapy (67.8% v 59.8%, respectively). Rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after lumpectomy were similar in both groups (7.9% and 5.8%, respectively; P = .23). Outcome was better in women whose tumors showed a pCR than in those with a pINV, cPR, or cNR (relapse-free survival [RFS] rates, 85.7%, 76.9%, 68.1%, and 63.9%, respectively; P < .0001), even when baseline prognostic variables were controlled. When prognostic models were compared for each treatment group, the preoperative model, which included breast tumor response as a variable, discriminated outcome among patients to about the same degree as the postoperative model.

Conclusion: Preoperative chemotherapy is as effective as postoperative chemotherapy, permits more lumpectomies, is appropriate for the treatment of certain patients with stages I and II disease, and can be used to study breast cancer biology. Tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy correlates with outcome and could be a surrogate for evaluating the effect of chemotherapy on micrometastases; however, knowledge of such a response provided little prognostic information beyond that which resulted from postoperative therapy.",2023-4-1,JCO.22.02571,[]

Aberrant hepatocyte growth factor/cMet pathway activation is an established resistance mechanism. Dual pathway targeting may overcome resistance.

Patients and Methods: This multicenter, randomized, noncomparative phase II study evaluated ficlatuzumab, an antihepatocyte growth factor mAb, with or without cetuximab in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. The primary end point was median progression-free survival (PFS); an arm met significance criteria if the lower bound of the 90% CI excluded the historical control of 2 months. Key eligibility criteria were HNSCC with known human papillomavirus (HPV) status, cetuximab resistance (progression within 6 months of exposure in the definitive or recurrent/metastatic setting), and resistance to platinum and anti–PD-1 mAb. Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), toxicity, and the association of HPV status and cMet overexpression with efficacy. Continuous Bayesian futility monitoring was used.

Results: From 2018 to 2020, 60 patients were randomly assigned and 58 were treated. Twenty-seven versus 33 patients were allocated to monotherapy versus combination. Arms were balanced for major prognostic factors. The monotherapy arm closed early for futility. The combination arm met prespecified significance criteria with a median PFS of 3.7 months (lower bound 90% CI, 2.3 months; P = .04); the ORR was 6 of 32 (19%), including two complete and four partial responses. Exploratory analyses were limited to the combination arm: the median PFS was 2.3 versus 4.1 months (P = .03) and the ORR was 0 of 16 (0%) versus 6 of 16 (38%; P = .02) in the HPV-positive versus HPV-negative subgroups, respectively. cMet overexpression was associated with reduced hazard of progression in HPV-negative but not HPV-positive disease (P interaction = .02).

Conclusion: The ficlatuzumab-cetuximab arm met significance criteria for PFS and warrants phase III development. HPV-negative HNSCC merits consideration as a selection criterion.",2023-8-1,JCO.22.01994,[]

This trial assessed the efficacy of olanzapine in stimulating appetite and improving weight gain in patients receiving chemotherapy.

Methods: Adults (≥18 years) with untreated, locally advanced, or metastatic gastric, hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB), and lung cancers were randomly assigned (double-blind) to receive olanzapine (2.5 mg once a day for 12 weeks) or placebo along with chemotherapy. Both groups received standard nutritional assessment and dietary advice. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients with weight gain > 5% and the improvement in appetite (assessed by the visual analog scale [VAS] and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy system of Quality-of-Life questionnaires Anorexia Cachexia subscale [FAACT ACS]). Secondary end points were change in nutritional status, quality of life (QOL), and chemotherapy toxicity.

Results: We enrolled 124 patients (olanzapine, 63 and placebo, 61) with a median age of 55 years (18-78 years), of whom 112 (olanzapine, 58 and placebo, 54) were analyzable. The majority (n = 99, 80%) had metastatic cancer (gastric [n = 68, 55%] > lung [n = 43, 35%] > HPB [n = 13, 10%]). The olanzapine arm had a greater proportion of patients with a weight gain of > 5% (35 of 58 [60%] v 5 of 54 [9%], P < .001) and improvement in appetite by VAS (25 of 58 [43%] v 7 of 54 [13%], P < .001) and by FAACT ACS (scores ≥37:13 of 58 [22%] v 2 of 54 [4%], P = .004). Patients on olanzapine had better QOL, nutritional status, and lesser chemotoxicity. Side effects attributable to olanzapine were minimal.

Conclusion: Low-dose, daily olanzapine is a simple, inexpensive, well-tolerated intervention that significantly improves appetite and weight gain in newly diagnosed patients on chemotherapy.",2023-5-10,JCO.22.01997,[]

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

The REMoDL-B phase III adaptive trial compared rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) versus R-CHOP + bortezomib (RB-CHOP) in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), stratified by molecular subtype. Primary analysis at a median follow-up of 30 months found no effect of bortezomib on progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). Retrospective analysis using a gene expression–based classifier identified a molecular high-grade (MHG) group with worse outcomes. We present an updated analysis for patients successfully classified by the gene expression profile (GEP). Eligible patients were age older than 18 years with untreated DLBCL, fit enough for full-dose chemotherapy, and with adequate biopsies for GEP. Of 1,077 patients registered, 801 were identified with Activated B-Cell (ABC), Germinal Center B-cell, or MHG lymphoma. At a median follow-up of 64 months, there was no overall benefit of bortezomib on PFS or OS (5-year PFS hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; P = .085; OS HR, 0.86; P = .32). However, improved PFS and OS were seen in ABC lymphomas after RB-CHOP: 5-year OS 67% with R-CHOP versus 80% with RB-CHOP (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.95; P = .032).

Homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene alterations, including BRCA1/2 alterations, can sensitize cancer cells to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition, which may improve outcomes in treatment-naïve mCRPC when combined with androgen receptor signaling inhibition.

Methods: MAGNITUDE (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03748641) is a phase III, randomized, double-blinded study that evaluates niraparib and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (niraparib + AAP) in patients with (HRR+, n = 423) or without (HRR−, n = 247) HRR-associated gene alterations, as prospectively determined by tissue/plasma-based assays. Patients were assigned 1:1 to receive niraparib + AAP or placebo + AAP. The primary end point, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) assessed by central review, was evaluated first in the BRCA1/2 subgroup and then in the full HRR+ cohort, with secondary end points analyzed for the full HRR+ cohort if rPFS was statistically significant. A futility analysis was preplanned in the HRR− cohort.

Results: Median rPFS in the BRCA1/2 subgroup was significantly longer in the niraparib + AAP group compared with the placebo + AAP group (16.6 v 10.9 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.79; P = .001). In the overall HRR+ cohort, rPFS was significantly longer in the niraparib + AAP group compared with the placebo + AAP group (16.5 v 13.7 months; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.96; P = .022). These findings were supported by improvement in the secondary end points of time to symptomatic progression and time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In the HRR− cohort, futility was declared per the prespecified criteria. Treatment with niraparib + AAP was tolerable, with anemia and hypertension as the most reported grade ≥ 3 adverse events.

Conclusion: Combination treatment with niraparib + AAP significantly lengthened rPFS in patients with HRR+ mCRPC compared with standard-of-care AAP.",2023-6-20,JCO.22.01649,"[{'Author': 'Kim N.

Patients and Methods: In this phase Ib escalation/expansion study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02974725), the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumor activity of naporafenib (LXH254), a BRAF/CRAF protein kinases inhibitor, were explored in combination with trametinib in patients with advanced/metastatic KRAS- or BRAF-mutant non–small-cell lung cancer (escalation arm) or NRAS-mutant melanoma (escalation and expansion arms).

Results: Thirty-six and 30 patients were enrolled in escalation and expansion, respectively. During escalation, six patients reported grade ≥3 dose-limiting toxicities, including dermatitis acneiform (n = 2), maculopapular rash (n = 2), increased lipase (n = 1), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (n = 1). The recommended doses for expansion were naporafenib 200 mg twice a day plus trametinib 1 mg once daily and naporafenib 400 mg twice a day plus trametinib 0.5 mg once daily. During expansion, all 30 patients experienced a treatment-related adverse event, the most common being rash (80%, n = 24), blood creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, and nausea (30%, n = 9 each). In expansion, the objective response rate, median duration of response, and median progression-free survival were 46.7% (95% CI, 21.3 to 73.4; 7 of 15 patients), 3.75 (95% CI, 1.97 to not estimable [NE]) months, and 5.52 months, respectively, in patients treated with naporafenib 200 mg twice a day plus trametinib 1 mg once daily, and 13.3% (95% CI, 1.7 to 40.5; 2 of 15 patients), 3.75 (95% CI, 2.04 to NE) months, and 4.21 months, respectively, in patients treated with naporafenib 400 mg twice a day plus trametinib 0.5 mg once daily.

Conclusion: Naporafenib plus trametinib showed promising preliminary antitumor activity in patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma.

The few systemic treatment options available only moderately prolong survival. Isolated hepatic perfusion (IHP) with melphalan is a regional treatment option, but prospective efficacy and safety data are lacking.

Methods: In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III trial, patients with previously untreated isolated liver metastases from uveal melanoma were randomly assigned to receive a one-time treatment with IHP with melphalan or best alternative care (control group). The primary end point was overall survival at 24 months. Here, we report the secondary outcomes of response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, progression-free survival (PFS), hepatic PFS (hPFS), and safety.

Results: Ninety-three patients were randomly assigned, and 87 patients were assigned to either IHP (n = 43) or a control group receiving the investigator's choice of treatment (n = 44). In the control group, 49% received chemotherapy, 39% immune checkpoint inhibitors, and 9% locoregional treatment other than IHP. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the overall response rates (ORRs) were 40% versus 4.5% in the IHP and control groups, respectively (P < .0001). The median PFS was 7.4 months versus 3.3 months (P < .0001), with a hazard ratio of 0.21 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.36), and the median hPFS was 9.1 months versus 3.3 months (P < .0001), both favoring the IHP arm.

Patients and Methods: One hundred fourteen women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive first-line treatment with trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 2 mg/kg weekly, or a higher 8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 4 mg/kg weekly.

Results: The objective response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.2% to 34.4%), with seven complete and 23 partial responses. Response rates in 111 assessable patients with 3+ and 2+ HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) were 35% (95% CI, 24.4% to 44.7%) and none (95% CI, 0% to 15.5%), respectively. The clinical benefit rates in assessable patients with 3+ and 2+ HER2 overexpression were 48% and 7%, respectively. The response rates in 108 assessable patients with and without HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis were 34% (95% CI, 23.9% to 45.7%) and 7% (95% CI, 0.8% to 22.8%), respectively. Seventeen (57%) of 30 patients with an objective response and 22 (51%) of 43 patients with clinical benefit had not experienced disease progression at follow-up at 12 months or later. The most common treatment-related adverse events were chills (25% of patients), asthenia (23%), fever (22%), pain (18%), and nausea (14%). Cardiac dysfunction occurred in two patients (2%); both had histories of cardiac disease and did not require additional intervention after discontinuation of trastuzumab. There was no clear evidence of a dose-response relationship for response, survival, or adverse events.

Conclusion: Single-agent trastuzumab is active and well tolerated as first-line treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer with HER2 3+ overexpression by IHC or gene amplification by FISH.",2023-3-20,JCO.22.02516,[]

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of Motivation And Problem Solving (MAPS), a novel treatment well-suited to meeting the smoking cessation needs of this population.

Methods: Women who were with a history of CIN or cervical cancer, age 18 years and older, spoke English or Spanish, and reported current smoking (≥100 lifetime cigarettes plus any smoking in the past 30 days) were eligible. Participants (N = 202) were recruited in clinic in Oklahoma City and online nationally and randomly assigned to (1) standard treatment (ST) or (2) MAPS. ST consisted of repeated referrals to a tobacco cessation quitline, self-help materials, and combination nicotine replacement therapy (patch plus lozenge). MAPS comprised all ST components plus up to six proactive telephone counseling sessions over 12 months. Logistic regression and generalized estimating equations evaluated the intervention. The primary outcome was self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence from tobacco at 18 months, with abstinence at 3, 6, and 12 months and biochemically confirmed abstinence as secondary outcomes.

Results: There was no significant effect for MAPS over ST at 18 months (14.2% v 12.9%, P = .79). However, there was a significant condition × assessment interaction (P = .015). Follow-up analyses found that MAPS (v ST) abstinence rates were significantly greater at 12 months (26.4% v 11.9%, P = .017; estimated OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.19 to 5.89).

Conclusion: MAPS led to a greater than two-fold increase in smoking abstinence among survivors of CIN and cervical cancer at 12 months. At 18 months, abstinence in MAPS declined to match the control condition and the treatment effect was no longer significant.",2023-5-20,JCO.22.01228,"[{'Author': 'Jennifer I.

Here, we present the 10-year results.

Methods: We randomly assigned 500 women with breast IEN (atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS], or hormone-sensitive or unknown DCIS) to low-dose tamoxifen or placebo after surgery with or without irradiation. The primary end point was the incidence of invasive breast cancer or DCIS.

Results: The TAM-01 population included 500 women (20% atypical ductal hyperplasia, 11% LCIS, and 69% DCIS). The mean (±SD) age at the start of treatment was 54 ± 9 years, and 58% of participants were postmenopausal. After a median follow-up of 9.7 years (IQR, 8.3-10.9 years), 66 breast cancers (15 in situ; 51 invasive) were diagnosed: 25 in the tamoxifen group and 41 in the placebo group (annual rate per 1,000 person-years, 11.3 with tamoxifen v 19.5 with placebo; hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.95; log-rank P = .03). Most recurrences were invasive (77%) and ipsilateral (59%). Regarding contralateral breast cancer incidence, there were six events in the tamoxifen arm and 16 in the placebo arm (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.92; P = .025). The number needed to be treated to prevent one case of breast event with tamoxifen therapy was 22 in 5 years and 14 in 10 years. The benefit was seen across all patient subgroups. There was a significant 50% reduction of recurrence with tamoxifen in the DCIS cohort, which represents 70% of the overall population (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.91; P = .02). No between-group difference in the incidence of serious adverse events was reported during the prolonged follow-up period.

Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) is an established treatment for testicular germ cell tumors with minimal late morbidity although little data exist on its efficacy in early metastatic seminoma. Surgery in early metastatic seminoma is a prospective phase II single-arm, multi-institutional trial of RPLND as first-line treatment for testicular seminoma with clinically low-volume retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

Patients and Methods: Twelve sites in the United States and Canada prospectively enrolled adult patients with testicular seminoma and isolated retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (1-3 cm). Open RPLND was performed by certified surgeons with a primary end point of 2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS). Complication rates, pathologic up/downstaging, recurrence patterns, adjuvant therapies, and treatment-free survival were assessed.

Results: A total of 55 patients were enrolled, with a median (IQR) largest clinical lymph node size of 1.6 cm (1.3-1.9). RPLND pathology demonstrated a median (IQR) largest lymph node size of 2.3 cm (0.9-3.5); nine patients (16%) were pN0, 12 (22%) pN1, 31 (56%) pN2, and 3 (5%) pN3. One patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. With a median (IQR) follow-up of 33 months (12.0-61.6), 12 patients experienced recurrence, with a 2-year RFS of 81% and a recurrence rate of 22%. Of the patients who experienced recurrence, 10 were treated with chemotherapy and two underwent additional surgery. At last follow-up, all patients who experienced a recurrence were disease-free and the 2-year overall survival was 100%. Four patients (7%) experienced short-term complications, and four patients experienced long-term complications including incisional hernia (1) and anejaculation (3).

Patients and Methods: Eligible patients had R/M ACC with progression within 6 months before enrollment. Treatment consisted of axitinib and avelumab. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1; secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Simon's optimal two-stage design tested the null hypothesis of ORR ≤5% versus ORR ≥20% at 6 months; ≥4 responses in 29 patients would reject the null hypothesis.

Results: Forty patients enrolled from July 2019 to June 2021; 28 were evaluable for efficacy (six screen failures; six evaluable for safety only). The confirmed ORR was 18% (95% CI, 6.1 to 36.9); there was one unconfirmed partial response (PR). Two patients achieved PR after 6 months; thus, the ORR at 6 months was 14%. The median follow-up time for surviving patients was 22 months (95% CI, 16.6 to 39.1 months). The median PFS was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 11.2 months), 6-month PFS rate was 57% (95% CI, 41 to 78), and median OS was 16.6 months (95% CI, 12.4 to not reached months). Most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included fatigue (62%), hypertension (32%), and diarrhea (32%). Ten (29%) patients had serious TRAEs, all grade 3; four patients (12%) discontinued avelumab, and nine patients (26%) underwent axitinib dose reduction.

Methods: We conducted a three-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled trial where older (50+ years), postmenopausal women cancer survivors participated in one of three supervised group exercise programs (tai ji quan, strength training, or stretching control) twice weekly for 6 months and were followed up 6 months after training stopped. The primary outcome was the incidence of falls. Secondary outcomes included fall-related injuries, leg strength (1 repetition maximum; kg), and balance (sensory organization [equilibrium score] and limits of stability [LOS; %] tests).

Results: Four hundred sixty-two women were enrolled (mean age, 62 ± 6.3 years). Retention was 93%, and adherence averaged 72.9%. In primary analysis, there was no difference in the incidence of falls between groups after 6 months of training, nor during 6-month follow-up. A post hoc analysis detected a significantly reduced incidence of fall-related injuries within the tai ji quan group over the first 6 months, dropping from 4.3 falls per 100 person-months (95% CI, 2.9 to 5.6) at baseline to 2.4 falls per person-months (95% CI, 1.2 to 3.5). No significant changes occurred during 6-month follow-up. Over the intervention period, leg strength significantly improved in the strength group and balance (LOS) improved in the tai ji quan group, compared with controls (P < .05).

Cluster of differentiation 47 blockade by magrolimab promotes macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of tumor cells and is synergistic with azacitidine, which increases expression of eat-me signals. We report final phase Ib data in patients with untreated higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) treated with magrolimab and azacitidine (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03248479).

Patients and Methods: Patients with previously untreated Revised International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-/high-/very high-risk MDS received magrolimab intravenously as a priming dose (1 mg/kg) followed by ramp-up to a 30 mg/kg once‐weekly or once‐every-2-week maintenance dose. Azacitidine 75 mg/m2 was administered intravenously/subcutaneously once daily on days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle. Primary end points were safety/tolerability and complete remission (CR) rate.

Results: Ninety-five patients were treated. Revised International Prognostic Scoring System risk was intermediate/high/very high in 27%, 52%, and 21%, respectively. Fifty-nine (62%) had poor-risk cytogenetics and 25 (26%) had TP53 mutation. The most common treatment-emergent adverse effects included constipation (68%), thrombocytopenia (55%), and anemia (52%). Median hemoglobin change from baseline to first postdose assessment was −0.7 g/dL (range, −3.1 to +2.4). CR rate and overall response rate were 33% and 75%, respectively. Median time to response, duration of CR, duration of overall response, and progression-free survival were 1.9, 11.1, 9.8, and 11.6 months, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached with 17.1-month follow-up. In TP53-mutant patients, 40% achieved CR with median OS of 16.3 months. Thirty-four patients (36%) had allogeneic stem-cell transplant with 77% 2-year OS.

Conclusion: Magrolimab + azacitidine was well tolerated with promising efficacy in patients with untreated higher-risk MDS, including those with TP53 mutations.

Multinational Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Humanized Anti-HER2 Monoclonal Antibody in Women Who Have HER2-Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer That Has Progressed After Chemotherapy for Metastatic Disease ,Melody A.  Cobleigh; Charles L.  Vogel; Debu  Tripathy; Nicholas J.  Robert; Susy  Scholl; Louis  Fehrenbacher; Janet M.  Wolter; Virginia  Paton; Steven  Shak; Gracie  Lieberman; Dennis J.  Slamon,France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.; France.,"Purpose: Overexpression of the HER2 protein occurs in 25% to 30% of human breast cancers and leads to a particularly aggressive form of the disease. Efficacy and safety of recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody as a single agent was evaluated in women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

Patients and Methods: Two hundred twenty-two women, with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after one or two chemotherapy regimens, were enrolled. Patients received a loading dose of 4 mg/kg intravenously, followed by a 2-mg/kg maintenance dose at weekly intervals.

Results: Study patients had advanced metastatic disease and had received extensive prior therapy. A blinded, independent response evaluation committee identified eight complete and 26 partial responses, for an objective response rate of 15% in the intent-to-treat population (95% confidence interval, 11% to 21%). The median duration of response was 9.1 months; the median duration of survival was 13 months. The most common adverse events, which occurred in approximately 40% of patients, were infusion-associated fever and/or chills that usually occurred only during the first infusion, and were of mild to moderate severity. These symptoms were treated successfully with acetaminophen and/or diphenhydramine. The most clinically significant adverse event was cardiac dysfunction, which occurred in 4.7% of patients. Only 1% of patients discontinued the study because of treatment-related adverse events.

Conclusion: Recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, administered as a single agent, produces durable objective responses and is well tolerated by women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Side effects that are commonly observed with chemotherapy, such as alopecia, mucositis, and neutropenia, are rarely seen.",2023-3-10,JCO.22.02510,[]

Here, we report the efficacy and safety of anti-GPRC5D chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) MM.

Methods: This phase Ⅱ, single-arm study enrolled patients (18-70 years) with R/R MM. Lymphodepletion was performed before patients received 2 × 106/kg anti-GPRC5D CAR T cells. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who achieved an overall response. Safety was also evaluated in eligible patients.

Results: From September 1, 2021, to March 23, 2022, 33 patients were infused with anti-GPRC5D CAR T cells. At a median follow-up of 5.2 months (range, 3.2‐8.9), the overall response rate was 91% (95% CI, 76 to 98; 30 of 33 patients), including 11 (33%) stringent complete responses, 10 (30%) complete responses, four (12%) very good partial responses, and five (15%) partial responses. Partial responses or better were observed in nine (100%) of nine patients with previous anti–B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR T-cell therapy, including two patients who had received repeated anti-BCMA CAR T-cell infusions with no responses at the last time. Grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicities were neutropenia (33 [100%]), anemia (17 [52%]), and thrombocytopenia (15 [45%]). Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 25 (76%) of 33 patients (all were grade 1 or 2), and neurotoxicities in three patients (one grade 2 and one grade 3 ICANSs and one grade 3 headache).

Conclusion: Anti-GPRC5D CAR T-cell therapy showed an encouraging clinical efficacy and manageable safety profile in patients with R/R MM. For patients with MM that progressed after anti-BCMA CAR T-cell therapy or that is refractory to anti-BCMA CAR T cell, anti-GPRC5D CAR T-cell therapy might be a potential alternative option.",2023-5-10,JCO.22.01824,"[{'Author': 'Yanlei Zhang', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: Shanghai YaKe Biotechnology Ltd']}, {'Author': 'Shuixiu Peng', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: Shanghai YaKe Biotechnology Ltd']}, {'Author': 'Chih-Hua Huang', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: Shanghai YaKe Biotechnology Ltd', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Cellectis, AB Science']}, {'Author': 'Alex H.

Pelabresib (CPI-0610) is an investigational, selective oral bromodomain and extraterminal domain inhibitor (BETi).

Methods: MANIFEST (ClinicalTrails.gov identifier: NCT02158858), a global, open-label, nonrandomized, multicohort, phase II study, includes a cohort of JAKi-naïve patients with myelofibrosis treated with pelabresib and ruxolitinib. The primary end point is a spleen volume reduction of ≥ 35% (SVR35) at 24 weeks.

Results: Eighty-four patients received ≥ 1 dose of pelabresib and ruxolitinib. The median age was 68 (range, 37-85) years; 24% of patients were intermediate-1 risk, 61% were intermediate-2 risk, and 16% were high risk as per the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System; 66% (55 of 84) of patients had a hemoglobin level of < 10 g/dL at baseline. At 24 weeks, 68% (57 of 84) achieved SVR35, and 56% (46 of 82) achieved a total symptom score reduction of ≥ 50% (TSS50). Additional benefits at week 24 included 36% (29 of 84) of patients with improved hemoglobin levels (mean, 1.3 g/dL; median, 0.8 g/dL), 28% (16 of 57) with ≥ 1 grade improvement in fibrosis, and 29.5% (13 of 44) with > 25% reduction in JAK2V617F-mutant allele fraction, which was associated with SVR35 response (P = .018, Fisher's exact test). At 48 weeks, 60% (47 of 79) of patients had SVR35 response. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities seen in ≥ 10% patients were thrombocytopenia (12%) and anemia (35%), leading to treatment discontinuation in three patients. 95% (80 of 84) of the study participants continued combination therapy beyond 24 weeks.

Conclusion: The rational combination of the BETi pelabresib and ruxolitinib in JAKi-naïve patients with myelofibrosis was well tolerated and showed durable improvements in spleen and symptom burden, with associated biomarker findings of potential disease-modifying activity.",2023-11-10,JCO.22.01972,"[{'Author': 'John Mascarenhas', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Incyte, Geron, Novartis, CTI BioPharma Corp, Kartos Therapeutics, Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Sierra Oncology, AbbVie, Roche/Genentech, PharmaEssentia, Karyopharm Therapeutics, Galecto', 'Research Funding: Incyte (Inst), PharmaEssentia (Inst), Merck (Inst), Geron (Inst), AbbVie (Inst), Kartos Therapeutics (Inst), Roche/Genentech (Inst), CTI BioPharma Corp (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Marina Kremyanskaya', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Protagonist Therapeutics, Incyte, AbbVie, CTI BioPharma Corp', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Protagonist Therapeutics, Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Incyte, AbbVie, CTI BioPharma Corp']}, {'Author': 'Andrea Patriarca', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Sanofi, SOBI', ""Speakers' Bureau: Novartis Italy, Incyte""]}, {'Author': 'Francesca Palandri', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Novartis, Celgene, AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals, Sierra Oncology, CTI', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, Celgene, AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals, Sierra Oncology, CTI']}, {'Author': 'Timothy Devos', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene, Incyte']}, {'Author': 'Francesco Passamonti', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: ROCHE, AMOMED, Novartis, Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb, Sandoz, Sierra Oncology, AbbVie, Karyopharma, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Oncology', ""Speakers' Bureau: Novartis, AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals, Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb, AbbVie""]}, {'Author': 'Raajit K.

We hypothesized that graft-versus-neuroblastoma effects could be elicited by transplantation of haploidentical stem cells (haplo-SCT) exploiting cytotoxic functions of natural killer cells and their activation by the anti-GD2 antibody dinutuximab beta (DB). This phase I/II trial assessed safety, feasibility, and outcomes of immunotherapy with DB plus subcutaneous interleukin-2 (scIL2) after haplo-SCT in patients with rHR-NB.

Methods: Patients age 1-21 years underwent T-/B-cell–depleted haplo-SCT followed by DB and scIL2. The primary end point ‘success of treatment’ encompassed patients receiving six cycles, being alive 180 days after end of trial treatment without progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, acute graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) ≥grade 3, or extensive chronic GvHD.

Results: Seventy patients were screened, and 68 were eligible for immunotherapy. Median number of DB cycles was 6 (range, 1-9). Median number of scIL2 cycles was 3 (1−6). The primary end point was met by 37 patients (54.4%). Median observation time was 7.8 years. Five-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival from start of trial treatment were 43% (95% CI, 31 to 55) and 53% (95% CI, 41 to 65), respectively. Five-year EFS among patients in complete remission (CR; 52%; 95% CI, 31 to 69) or partial remission (44%; 95% CI, 27 to 60) before immunotherapy were significantly better compared with patients with nonresponse/mixed response/progressive disease (13%; 95% CI, 1 to 42; P = .026). Overall response rate in 43 patients with evidence of disease after haplo-SCT was 51% (22 patients), with 15 achieving CR (35%). Two patients developed GvHD grade 2 and 3 each. No unexpected adverse events occurred.

The RMS2005 study included two phase III randomized trials for high-risk (HR) and observational trials for low (LR), standard (SR), and very high-risk (VHR) patients who have been partially reported. Herein, we present a comprehensive report of results achieved for the complete unselected nonmetastatic cohort and analyze the evolution of treatment in comparison with previous European protocols. After a median follow-up of 73.1 months, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of the 1,733 patients enrolled were 70.7% (95% CI, 68.5 to 72.8) and 80.4% (95% CI, 78.4 to 82.3), respectively. The results by subgroup: LR (80 patients) EFS 93.7% (95% CI, 85.5 to 97.3), OS 96.7% (95% CI, 87.2 to 99.2); SR (652 patients) EFS 77.4% (95% CI, 73.9 to 80.5), OS 90.6% (95% CI, 87.9 to 92.7); HR (851 patients) EFS 67.3% (95% CI, 64.0 to 70.4), OS 76.7% (95% CI, 73.6 to 79.4); and VHR (150 patients) EFS 48.8% (95% CI, 40.4 to 56.7), OS 49.7% (95% CI, 40.8 to 57.9). The RMS2005 study demonstrated that 80% of children with localized rhabdomyosarcoma could be long-term survivors. The study has established the standard of care across the European pediatric Soft tissue sarcoma Study Group countries with the confirmation of a 22-week vincristine/actinomycin D regimen for LR patients, the reduction of the cumulative ifosfamide dose in the SR group, and for HR disease, the omission of doxorubicin and the addition of maintenance chemotherapy.",2023-5-1,JCO.22.02093,"[{'Author': 'Gianni Bisogno', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bayer']}, {'Author': 'Veronique Minard-Colin', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Roche/Genentech (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Soledad Gallego', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bayer']}, {'Author': 'Henry Mandeville', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Merck Serono']}, {'Author': 'Anna Kelsey', 'Disclosures': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bayer']}, {'Author': 'Daniel Orbach', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Bayer Health (Inst), Bayer Health (Inst), Roche (Inst), EUSA Pharma (Inst), Novartis (Inst)', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Bayer', 'Research Funding: Bayer (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Johannes Hendrikus Maria Merks', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck KGaA']}, {'Author': 'Meriel Jenney', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Bayer (Inst)', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

We present 5-year outcomes from the phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02578680). Eligible patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous non–small-cell lung cancer without EGFR/ALK alterations were randomly assigned 2:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo once every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles with pemetrexed and investigator's choice of carboplatin/cisplatin for four cycles, followed by maintenance pemetrexed until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Among 616 randomly assigned patients (n = 410, pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-platinum; n = 206, placebo plus pemetrexed-platinum), median time from random assignment to data cutoff (March 8, 2022) was 64.6 (range, 60.1-72.4) months. Hazard ratio (95% CI) for OS was 0.60 (0.50 to 0.72) and PFS was 0.50 (0.42 to 0.60) for pembrolizumab plus platinum-pemetrexed versus placebo plus platinum-pemetrexed. 5-year OS rates were 19.4% versus 11.3%. Toxicity was manageable. Among 57 patients who completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab, objective response rate was 86.0% and 3-year OS rate after completing 35 cycles (approximately 5 years after random assignment) was 71.9%. Pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-platinum maintained OS and PFS benefits versus placebo plus pemetrexed-platinum, regardless of programmed cell death ligand-1 expression.

There is a strong rationale for investigating mesenchymal epithelial transition receptor (MET) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibition in this disease. In this study, the combination of savolitinib (MET inhibitor) and durvalumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) is investigated.

Methods: This single-arm phase II trial explored durvalumab (1,500 mg once every four weeks) and savolitinib (600 mg once daily; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02819596). Treatment-naïve or previously treated patients with metastatic PRC were included. A confirmed response rate (cRR) of > 50% was the primary end point. Progression-free survival, tolerability, and overall survival were secondary end points. Biomarkers were explored from archived tissue (MET-driven status).

Results: Forty-one patients treated with advanced PRC were enrolled into this study and received at least one dose of study treatment. The majority of patients had Heng intermediate risk score (n = 26 [63%]). The cRR was 29% (n = 12; 95% CI, 16 to 46), and the trial therefore missed the primary end point. The cRR increased to 53% (95% CI, 28 to 77) in MET-driven patients (n/N = 9/27) and was 33% (95% CI, 17 to 54) in PD-L1–positive tumors (n/N = 9/27). The median progression-free survival was 4.9 months (95% CI, 2.5 to 10.0) in the treated population and 12.0 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 19.4) in MET-driven patients. The median overall survival was 14.1 months (95% CI, 7.3 to 30.7) in the treated population and 27.4 months (95% CI, 9.3 to not reached [NR]) in MET-driven patients. Grade 3 and above treatment related adverse events occurred in 17 (41%) patients. There was 1 grade 5 treatment-related adverse event (cerebral infarction).

Trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1), antibody-drug conjugate, is highly effective in HER2+ EBC; however, no survival data are available for de-escalated antibody-drug conjugate–based neoadjuvant therapy without conventional chemotherapy.

Patients and Methods: In the WSG-ADAPT-TP (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01779206) phase II trial, 375 centrally reviewed patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2+ EBC (clinical stage I-III) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of T-DM1 with or without endocrine therapy (ET) or trastuzumab + ET once every 3 weeks (ratio 1:1:1). Adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) omission was allowed in patients with pathologic complete response (pCR). In this study, we report the secondary survival end points and biomarker analysis. Patients who received at least one dose of study treatment were analyzed. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, two-sided log-rank statistics, and Cox regression models stratified for nodal and menopausal status. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.

Results: T-DM1, T-DM1 + ET, and trastuzumab + ET induced similar 5-year invasive disease-free survival (iDFS; 88.9%, 85.3%, 84.6%; Plog-rank = .608) and overall survival rates (97.2%, 96.4%, 96.3%; Plog-rank = .534). Patients with pCR versus non-pCR had improved 5-year iDFS rates (92.7% v 82.7%; hazard ratio, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.85]). Among the 117 patients with pCR, 41 did not receive ACT; 5-year iDFS rates were similar in those with (93.0% [95% CI, 84.0 to 97.0]) and without ACT (92.1% [95% CI, 77.5 to 97.4]; Plog-rank = .848). Translational research revealed that tumors with PIK3CA wild type, high immune marker expression, and luminal-A tumors (by PAM50) had an excellent prognosis with de-escalated anti-HER2 therapy.

Conclusion: The WSG-ADAPT-TP trial demonstrated that pCR after 12 weeks of chemotherapy-free de-escalated neoadjuvant therapy was associated with excellent survival in HR+/HER2+ EBC without further ACT. Despite higher pCR rates for T-DM1 ± ET versus trastuzumab + ET, all trial arms had similar outcomes because of mandatory standard chemotherapy after non-pCR.

Smith,IL; Belgium; Canada; France; NY; CA; SC; Russian Federation; CA; Germany; China; Brazil; Japan; Singapore; NJ; Switzerland; Germany; Finland; MA,"Purpose: For patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, metastatic burden affects outcome. We examined efficacy and safety from the ARASENS trial for subgroups by disease volume and risk.

METHODS: Patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were randomly assigned to darolutamide or placebo plus androgen-deprivation therapy and docetaxel. High-volume disease was defined as visceral metastases and/or ≥ 4 bone metastases with ≥ 1 beyond the vertebral column/pelvis. High-risk disease was defined as ≥ 2 risk factors: Gleason score ≥ 8, ≥ 3 bone lesions, and presence of measurable visceral metastases.

Results: Of 1,305 patients, 1,005 (77%) had high-volume disease and 912 (70%) had high-risk disease. Darolutamide increased overall survival (OS) versus placebo in patients with high-volume (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82), high-risk (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.86), and low-risk disease (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.90), and in the smaller low-volume subgroup, the results were also suggestive of survival benefit (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.13). Darolutamide improved clinically relevant secondary end points of time to castration-resistant prostate cancer and subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy versus placebo in all disease volume and risk subgroups. Adverse events (AEs) were similar between treatment groups across subgroups. Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in 64.9% of darolutamide patients versus 64.2% of placebo patients in the high-volume subgroup and 70.1% versus 61.1% in the low-volume subgroup. Among the most common AEs, many were known toxicities related to docetaxel.

Conclusion: In patients with high-volume and high-risk/low-risk metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, treatment intensification with darolutamide, androgen-deprivation therapy, and docetaxel increased OS with a similar AE profile in the subgroups, consistent with the overall population.",2023-7-10,JCO.23.00041,[]
Multi-Institutional Randomized Phase II Trial of Gefitinib for Previously Treated Patients With Advanced Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer,Masahiro  Fukuoka; Seiji  Yano; Giuseppe  Giaccone; Tomohide  Tamura; Kazuhiko  Nakagawa; Jean-Yves  Douillard; Yutaka  Nishiwaki; Johan  Vansteenkiste; Shinzoh  Kudoh; Danny  Rischin; Richard  Eek; Takeshi  Horai; Kazumasa  Noda; Ichiro  Takata; Egbert  Smit; Steven  Averbuch; Angela  Macleod; Andrea  Feyereislova; Rui-Ping  Dong; José  Baselga,Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.; Spain.,"Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of gefitinib (Iressa [ZD1839]; AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE), a novel epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with pretreated advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Patients and Methods: This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter phase II trial. Two hundred ten patients with advanced NSCLC who were previously treated with one or two chemotherapy regimens (at least one containing platinum) were randomized to receive either 250-mg or 500-mg oral doses of gefitinib once daily.

Results: Efficacy was similar for the 250- and 500-mg/d groups. Objective tumor response rates were 18.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5 to 27.3) and 19.0% (95% CI, 12.1 to 27.9); among evaluable patients, symptom improvement rates were 40.3% (95% CI, 28.5 to 53.0) and 37.0% (95% CI, 26.0 to 49.1); median progression-free survival times were 2.7 and 2.8 months; and median overall survival times were 7.6 and 8.0 months, respectively. Symptom improvements were recorded for 69.2% (250 mg/d) and 85.7% (500 mg/d) of patients with a tumor response. Adverse events (AEs) at both dose levels were generally mild (grade 1 or 2) and consisted mainly of skin reactions and diarrhea. Drug-related toxicities were more frequent in the higher-dose group. Withdrawal due to drug-related AEs was 1.9% and 9.4% for patients receiving gefitinib 250 and 500 mg/d, respectively.

Conclusion: Gefitinib showed clinically meaningful antitumor activity and provided symptom relief as second- and third-line treatment in these patients. At 250 mg/d, gefitinib had a favorable AE profile. Gefitinib 250 mg/d is an important, novel treatment option for patients with pretreated advanced NSCLC.",2023-2-20,JCO.22.02499,[]
Improving Uptake of Cancer Genetic Risk Assessment in a Remote Tailored Risk Communication and Navigation Intervention: Large Effect Size but Room to Grow,Anita Y.  Kinney; Scott T.

Toppmeyer; Jean A.  McDougall,NJ; NJ; TX; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; NM; NJ; NM,"Purpose: Cancer genetic risk assessment (CGRA) is recommended for women with ovarian cancer or high-risk breast cancer, yet fewer than 30% receive recommended genetic services, with the lowest rates among underserved populations. We hypothesized that compared with usual care (UC) and mailed targeted print (TP) education, CGRA uptake would be highest among women receiving a phone-based tailored risk counseling and navigation intervention (TCN).

Methods: In this three-arm randomized trial, women with ovarian or high-risk breast cancer were recruited from statewide cancer registries in Colorado, New Jersey, and New Mexico. Participants assigned to TP received a mailed educational brochure. Participants assigned to TCN received the mailed educational brochure, an initial phone-based psychoeducational session with a health coach, a follow-up letter, and a follow-up navigation phone call.

Results: Participants' average age was 61 years, 25.4% identified as Hispanic, 5.9% identified as non-Hispanic Black, and 17.5% lived in rural areas. At 6 months, more women in TCN received CGRA (18.7%) than those in TP (3%; odds ratio, 7.4; 95% CI, 3.0 to 18.3; P < .0001) or UC (2.5%; odds ratio, 8.9; 95% CI, 3.4 to 23.5; P < .0001). There were no significant differences in CGRA uptake between TP and UC. Commonly cited barriers to genetic counseling were lack of provider referral (33.7%) and cost (26.5%), whereas anticipated difficulty coping with test results (14.0%) and cost (41.2%) were barriers for genetic testing.

Conclusion: TCN increased CGRA uptake in a group of geographically and ethnically diverse high-risk breast and ovarian cancer survivors. Remote personalized interventions that incorporate evidence-based health communication and behavior change strategies may increase CGRA among women recruited from statewide cancer registries.",2023-5-20,JCO.22.00751,"[{'Author': 'Anita Y.

Patients and Methods: Approval was based on DESTINY-Breast04, a phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial in patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-low breast cancer, determined at a central laboratory. A total of 557 patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks (n = 373) or physicians' choice of chemotherapy (n = 184).

Results: The study met its primary efficacy end point of progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review assessment in the hormone receptor–positive (HR+) cohort (N = 494) with an estimated hazard ratio (HR) of 0.51(95% CI, 0.40 to 0.64; P < .0001). Key secondary end points were also met, including PFS in the intent-to-treat population with an HR of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.63; P < .0001), overall survival (OS) in the HR+ cohort with an HR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.86; P = .0028) and OS in the intent-to-treat with an HR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.84; P = .0010). The safety profile of T-DXd was consistent with previously approved indications, and no new safety signals were observed in this study population.

Conclusion: The approval of T-DXd in HER2-low metastatic breast cancer was based on statistically significant and clinically meaningful PFS and OS improvements observed in the DESTINY-Breast04 trial and represents the first approved therapy specifically for the treatment of HER2-low metastatic breast cancer.",2023-4-10,JCO.22.02447,"[{'Author': 'Asma Dilawari', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Paxman (Inst)', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

In addition, bortezomib has shown significant activity in WM. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of dexamethasone, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide (DRC) as first-line treatment in WM.

Methods: In this European study, treatment-naïve patients were randomly assigned to DRC or bortezomib-DRC B-DRC for six cycles. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included response rates, overall survival, and safety.

Results: Two hundred four patients were registered. After a median follow-up of 27.5 months, the estimated 24-month progression-free survival was 80.6% (95% CI, 69.5 to 88.0) for B-DRC and 72.8% (95% CI, 61.3 to 81.3) for DRC (P = .32). At the end of treatment, B-DRC and DRC induced major responses in 80.6% versus 69.9% and a complete response/very good partial response in 17.2% versus 9.6% of patients, respectively. The median time to first response was shorter for B-DRC with 3.0 (95% CI, 2.8 to 3.2) versus 5.5 (95% CI, 2.9 to 5.8) months for DRC. This resulted in higher major response rates (57.0% v 32.5%; P < .01) after three cycles of B-DRC compared with DRC. At best response, the complete response/very good partial response increased to 32.6% for B-DRC. Both treatments were well tolerated: grade ≥ 3 adverse events occurred in 49.2% of all patients (B-DRC, 49.5%; DRC, 49.0%). Peripheral sensory neuropathy grade 3 occurred in two patients treated with B-DRC and in none with DRC.

ANCHOR CRC aimed to evaluate efficacy, safety, and quality of life with first-line encorafenib + binimetinib + cetuximab in BRAFV600E-mutated mCRC.

Methods: In this multicenter, open-label, single-arm study, patients with BRAFV600E-mutated mCRC received oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily and binimetinib 45 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles, plus intravenous cetuximab 400 mg/m2 once on day 1 of cycle 1, then 250 mg/m2 once weekly for the first seven cycles, and 500 mg/m2 once on Days 1 and 15 from cycle 8 onward. The primary end point was locally assessed confirmed objective response rate (cORR), and secondary end points included centrally assessed cORR, progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), quality of life, and safety and tolerability.

Results: Among 95 patients, the locally assessed cORR was 47.4% (95% CI, 37.0 to 57.9) with all partial responses. Since the lower limit of the 95% CI exceeded 30%, the primary end point was met. With a median follow-up duration of 20.1 months, the median progression-free survival on the basis of local assessments was 5.8 months and the median OS was 18.3 months. Treatment was well tolerated, with no unexpected toxicities. Using Patient Global Impression of Changes, substantial improvement in symptoms was consistently reported in ≥ 30% of patients from cycle 3 to cycle 10.

Conclusion: The ANCHOR CRC study showed that the scientifically driven combination of encorafenib + binimetinib + cetuximab was active in the first-line setting of BRAFV600E-mutated mCRC with a manageable safety profile.

Darolutamide Maintenance in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer With Nonprogressive Disease After Taxane Treatment (SAKK 08/16),Silke  Gillessen; Giuseppe  Procopio; Stefanie  Hayoz; Eloïse  Kremer; Michael  Schwitter; Orazio  Caffo; David  Lorente; Augusto  Pedrazzini; Guilhem  Roubaud; Soazig  Nenan; Aurelius  Omlin; Consuelo  Buttigliero; Juan Ignacio  Delgado Mingorance; Aránzazu  González-del-Alba; Maria Teresa  Delgado; Franco  Nole; Fabio  Turco; Ricardo  Pereira Mestre; Karin  Ribi; Richard  Cathomas,Switzerland; Switzerland; Italy; Switzerland; Switzerland; Switzerland; Italy; Spain; Switzerland; France; France; Switzerland; Switzerland; Italy; Spain; Spain; Spain; Italy; Switzerland; Italy; Switzerland; Switzerland; Switzerland; Switzerland,"Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of darolutamide maintenance after successful taxane chemotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

Patients and Methods: Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) 08/16 is a randomized phase II study. Patients with mCRPC who received prior androgen-receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and subsequently had nonprogressive disease on a taxane were randomly assigned to darolutamide 600 mg twice a day or placebo twice a day. The primary end point was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) at 12 weeks. Secondary end points were rPFS, event-free survival, overall survival (OS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 50% response rate, and adverse events.

Results: Overall, 92 patients were recruited by 26 centers. Prior taxane was docetaxel in 93% and cabazitaxel in 7%. Prior ARPI was abiraterone in 60%, enzalutamide in 31%, and both in 9%. rPFS at 12 weeks was significantly improved with darolutamide (64.7% v 52.2%; P = .127). Median rPFS on darolutamide was 5.5 versus 4.5 months on placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.32 to 0.91]; P = .017), and median event-free survival was 5.4 versus 2.9 months (HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.29 to 0.73]; P = .001). PSA 50% response rate was improved (22% v 4%; P = .014). Median OS for darolutamide was 24 versus 21.3 months for placebo (HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.3 to 1.26]; P = .181). Treatment-related adverse events were similar in both arms.

Conclusion: SAKK 08/16 met its primary end point, showing that switch maintenance with darolutamide after prior taxane chemotherapy and at least one ARPI resulted in a statistically significant but clinically modest rPFS prolongation with good tolerability. The median OS with darolutamide maintenance appears promising. Should these findings be confirmed in a larger trial, maintenance treatment could be a novel strategy in managing patients with mCRPC, especially those who responded well to prior ARPI.",2023-7-10,JCO.22.01726,"[{'Author': 'Silke Gillessen', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bayer (Inst), MSD Oncology (Inst), Amgen (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), BMS (Inst), Telix Pharma (Inst), AAA HealthCare (Inst), Orion (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Modra Pharmaceuticals (Inst), Myriad Genetics (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), TOLREMO (Inst), Silvio Grasso Consulting (Inst), WebMD/Medscape (Inst), ESMO, Swiss Academy of Multidisciplinary oncology (SAMO), Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK), German-speaking European School of Oncology (DESO), Radiotelevisione Svizzera Italiana (RSI)', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Method for biomarker (WO 3752009138392 A1)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: AstraZeneca', 'Other Relationship: ProteoMediX']}, {'Author': 'Giuseppe Procopio', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bayer, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), Janssen, Novartis, Pfizer, Ipsen, Merck Sharp & Dohme, AstraZeneca, Eisai, MSD Oncology', 'Research Funding: Astellas Pharma, Ipsen, Janssen Oncology']}, {'Author': 'Orazio Caffo', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Astellas Pharma, Janssen Oncology, Bayer, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Ipsen', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Astellas Medivation, Janssen, MSD Oncology, Advanced Accelerator Applications, Bayer', ""Speakers' Bureau: Astellas Pharma""]}, {'Author': 'David Lorente', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca Spain, Janssen Oncology, Sanofi, Bayer, Astellas Pharma', ""Speakers' Bureau: AstraZeneca, Janssen Oncology, Astellas Pharma, Bayer, Ipsen, MSD Oncology, BMSi"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen Oncology, Astellas Pharma, Pfizer, Sanofi, Bayer']}, {'Author': 'Guilhem Roubaud', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Astellas Pharma (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Janssen-Cilag (Inst)', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Astellas Pharma (Inst), Janssen-Cilag (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Ipsen (Inst), AAA/Endocyte/Novartis (Inst), Merck/Pfizer (Inst), Bayer (Inst)', 'Research Funding: Bayer (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Astellas Pharma, Janssen-Cilag, Bayer']}, {'Author': 'Aurelius Omlin', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Astellas Pharma (Inst), Bayer (Inst), Sanofi (Inst), Roche (Inst), Janssen (Inst), MSD (Inst), Molecular Partners (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst)', ""Speakers' Bureau: Bayer (Inst), Astellas Pharma (Inst), Janssen-Cilag (Inst)Tripple AAA, AstraZeneca (Inst)"", 'Research Funding: Teva (Inst), Janssen (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Sanofi, Bayer, Astellas Pharma, Janssen']}, {'Author': 'Consuelo ButtIgliero', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen-Cilag, Merck, Astellas Pharma, AstraZeneca', ""Speakers' Bureau: Ipsen""]}, {'Author': 'Aránzazu González-del-Alba', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Sanofi/Aventis, Roche, Pfizer, Astellas Pharma, Janssen-Cilag, Novartis, Ipsen', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Astellas Pharma, Sanofi, Bayer, Janssen Oncology, Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eisai, EUSA Pharma, Roche, Novartis, Ipsen, AstraZeneca, MSD Oncology, Eisai, Advanced Accelerator Applications', ""Speakers' Bureau: Ipsen, Roche, Pfizer, Janssen-Cilag, Advanced Accelerator Applications, Astellas Pharma"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Astellas Pharma, Pfizer, Janssen Oncology, Sanofi, Bristol Myers Squibb, MSD Oncology, Roche, Ipsen']}, {'Author': 'Fabio Turco', 'Disclosures': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bayer']}, {'Author': 'Richard Cathomas', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Janssen-Cilag, Astellas Pharma', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Astellas Pharma (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Pfizer, Roche (Inst), MSD Oncology, Janssen-Cilag, Bayer (Inst), Sanofi (Inst), Ipsen (Inst)', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

Stephen  Hodi,NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.; NJ.,"Purpose: Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory receptor expressed by activated T cells that downmodulates effector functions and limits the generation of immune memory. PD-1 blockade can mediate tumor regression in a substantial proportion of patients with melanoma, but it is not known whether this is associated with extended survival or maintenance of response after treatment is discontinued.

Patients and Methods: Patients with advanced melanoma (N = 107) enrolled between 2008 and 2012 received intravenous nivolumab in an outpatient setting every 2 weeks for up to 96 weeks and were observed for overall survival, long-term safety, and response duration after treatment discontinuation.

Results: Median overall survival in nivolumab-treated patients (62% with two to five prior systemic therapies) was 16.8 months, and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 62% and 43%, respectively. Among 33 patients with objective tumor regressions (31%), the Kaplan-Meier estimated median response duration was 2 years. Seventeen patients discontinued therapy for reasons other than disease progression, and 12 (71%) of 17 maintained responses off-therapy for at least 16 weeks (range, 16 to 56+ weeks). Objective response and toxicity rates were similar to those reported previously; in an extended analysis of all 306 patients treated on this trial (including those with other cancer types), exposure-adjusted toxicity rates were not cumulative.

Conclusion: Overall survival following nivolumab treatment in patients with advanced treatment–refractory melanoma compares favorably with that in literature studies of similar patient populations. Responses were durable and persisted after drug discontinuation. Long-term safety was acceptable. Ongoing randomized clinical trials will further assess the impact of nivolumab therapy on overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma.",2023-2-10,JCO.22.02272,[]

We investigated the activity and safety of this regimen for recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

Methods: This single-arm, Simon two-stage study enrolled patients with recurrent/metastatic NPC who were refractory to at least first-line systemic therapy and treatment-naive to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The patients received camrelizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks and apatinib 250 mg once per day. The primary end point was the objective response rate. Key secondary end points included disease control rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, and safety.

Results: Between October 14, 2020, and December 23, 2021, 58 patients were enrolled, and all were included in the efficacy and safety analysis set. The objective response rate was 65.5% (95% CI, 51.9 to 77.5), and the disease control rate was 86.2% (95% CI, 74.6 to 93.9). The median duration of response was not reached, and the median progression-free survival was 10.4 months (95% CI, 7.2 to 13.6), with a median follow-up duration of 12.4 months (range, 2.1-19.9 months). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of grade 3 or higher were reported in 34 (58.6%) patients, with the most common being hypertension (19.0%), nasopharyngeal necrosis (15.5%), headache (12.1%), AST elevation (10.3%), and creatine phosphokinase elevation (10.3%). Sixteen (27.6%) patients discontinued apatinib treatment before progression because of unbearable TRAEs, and the most common complication was nasopharyngeal necrosis (9/16; 56.3%). Recurrent nasopharyngeal lesions (odds ratio, 5.94 [95% CI, 1.45 to 24.24]) and reirradiation (odds ratio, 5.33 [95% CI, 1.15 to 24.79]) were significantly positively correlated with nasopharyngeal necrosis.

Conclusion: Camrelizumab plus apatinib had promising antitumor activity in patients with refractory recurrent/metastatic NPC who failed first-line therapy. Moderate to severe TRAEs were experienced by 58.6%, including nasopharyngeal necrosis associated with local recurrence and a history of reirradiation.",2023-5-10,JCO.22.01450,[]

We report 5-year efficacy and safety outcomes from the phase III KEYNOTE-407 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02775435). Eligible patients with previously untreated, metastatic squamous non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomly assigned 1:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo plus carboplatin and paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel once every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by pembrolizumab or placebo for up to 35 cycles. Primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST version 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Five hundred fifty-nine patients were randomly assigned in the intention-to-treat population (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, n = 278; placebo plus chemotherapy, n = 281). The median time from random assignment to data cutoff was 56.9 (range, 49.9-66.2) months. OS and PFS were improved with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus placebo plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.71 [0.59 to 0.85] and 0.62 [0.52 to 0.74]), with 5-year OS rates of 18.4% versus 9.7%, respectively. Toxicity was manageable. Among 55 patients who completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab, the objective response rate was 90.9% and the 3-year OS rate after completion of 35 cycles (approximately 5 years after random assignment) was 69.5%.

We report an updated exploratory analysis of final DFS data.

Methods: Overall, 682 patients with stage IB-IIIA (American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control, seventh edition) EGFR-mutated (exon 19 deletion/L858R) NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 (stratified by stage, mutational status, and race) to receive osimertinib 80 mg once-daily or placebo for 3 years. The primary end point was DFS by investigator assessment in stage II-IIIA disease analyzed by stratified log-rank test; following early reporting of statistical significance in DFS, no further formal statistical testing was planned. Secondary end points included DFS in stage IB-IIIA, overall survival, and safety. Patterns of recurrence and CNS DFS were prespecified exploratory end points.

Results: At data cutoff (April 11, 2022), in stage II-IIIA disease, median follow-up was 44.2 months (osimertinib) and 19.6 months (placebo); the DFS HR was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.30); 4-year DFS rate was 70% (osimertinib) and 29% (placebo). In the overall population, DFS HR was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.34); 4-year DFS rate was 73% (osimertinib) and 38% (placebo). Fewer patients treated with osimertinib had local/regional and distant recurrence versus placebo. CNS DFS HR in stage II-IIIA was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.42). The long-term safety profile of osimertinib was consistent with the primary analysis.

Mirvetuximab soravtansine (MIRV) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting folate receptor α (FRα). SORAYA is a single-arm, phase II study evaluating efficacy and safety of MIRV in patients with PROC.

Methods: SORAYA enrolled FRα-high patients with PROC who had received one to three prior therapies, including required bevacizumab. The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by investigator; duration of response was the key secondary end point.

Results: One hundred six patients were enrolled; 105 were evaluable for efficacy. All patients had received prior bevacizumab, 51% had three prior lines of therapy, and 48% received a prior poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor. Median follow-up was 13.4 months. ORR was 32.4% (95% CI, 23.6 to 42.2), including five complete and 29 partial responses. The median duration of response was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 9.7). In patients with one to two priors, the ORR by investigator was 35.3% (95% CI, 22.4 to 49.9) and in patients with three priors was 30.2% (95% CI, 18.3 to 44.3). The ORR by investigator was 38.0% (95% CI, 24.7 to 52.8) in patients with prior poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor exposure and 27.5% (95% CI, 15.9 to 41.7) in those without. The most common treatment-related adverse events (all grade and grade 3-4) were blurred vision (41% and 6%), keratopathy (29% and 9%), and nausea (29% and 0%). Treatment-related adverse events led to dose delays, reductions, and discontinuations in 33%, 20%, and 9% of patients, respectively.

Conclusion: MIRV demonstrated consistent clinically meaningful antitumor activity and favorable tolerability and safety in patients with FRα-high PROC who had received up to three prior therapies, including bevacizumab, representing an important advance for this biomarker-selected population.",2023-5-1,JCO.22.01900,"[{'Author': 'Ursula A.

Topalian,CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.; CA.,"Purpose: Programmed death-1 (PD-1), an inhibitory receptor expressed on activated T cells, may suppress antitumor immunity. This phase I study sought to determine the safety and tolerability of anti–PD-1 blockade in patients with treatment-refractory solid tumors and to preliminarily assess antitumor activity, pharmacodynamics, and immunologic correlates.

Patients and Methods: Thirty-nine patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, colorectal cancer (CRC), castrate-resistant prostate cancer, non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or renal cell carcinoma (RCC) received a single intravenous infusion of anti–PD-1 (MDX-1106) in dose-escalating six-patient cohorts at 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg, followed by a 15-patient expansion cohort at 10 mg/kg. Patients with evidence of clinical benefit at 3 months were eligible for repeated therapy.

Results: Anti–PD-1 was well tolerated: one serious adverse event, inflammatory colitis, was observed in a patient with melanoma who received five doses at 1 mg/kg. One durable complete response (CRC) and two partial responses (PRs; melanoma, RCC) were seen. Two additional patients (melanoma, NSCLC) had significant lesional tumor regressions not meeting PR criteria. The serum half-life of anti–PD-1 was 12 to 20 days. However, pharmacodynamics indicated a sustained mean occupancy of > 70% of PD-1 molecules on circulating T cells ≥ 2 months following infusion, regardless of dose. In nine patients examined, tumor cell surface B7-H1 expression appeared to correlate with the likelihood of response to treatment.

Conclusion: Blocking the PD-1 immune checkpoint with intermittent antibody dosing is well tolerated and associated with evidence of antitumor activity. Exploration of alternative dosing regimens and combinatorial therapies with vaccines, targeted therapies, and/or other checkpoint inhibitors is warranted.",2023-2-1,JCO.22.02270,[]

Docetaxel was assessed as a radiosensitizer in this situation.

Methods: This was a randomized phase II/III study. Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with LAHNSCC planned for chemoradiation and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 and who were cisplatin-ineligible were randomly assigned in 1:1 to either radiation alone or radiation with concurrent docetaxel 15 mg/m2 once weekly for a maximum of seven cycles. The primary end point was 2-year disease-free survival (DFS).

Results: The study recruited 356 patients between July 2017 and May 2021. The 2-year DFS was 30.3% (95% CI, 23.6 to 37.4) versus 42% (95% CI, 34.6 to 49.2) in the RT and Docetaxel-RT arms, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.673; 95% CI, 0.521 to 0.868; P value = .002).

Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) is aberrantly expressed in most SCLC. Tarlatamab (AMG 757), a bispecific T-cell engager molecule, binds both DLL3 and CD3 leading to T-cellb–mediated tumor lysis. Herein, we report phase I results of tarlatamab in patients with SCLC.

Patients AND METHODS: This study evaluated tarlatamab in patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC. The primary end point was safety. Secondary end points included antitumor activity by modified RECIST 1.1, overall survival, and pharmacokinetics.

Results: By July 19, 2022, 107 patients received tarlatamab in dose exploration (0.003 to 100 mg; n = 73) and expansion (100 mg; n = 34) cohorts. Median prior lines of anticancer therapy were 2 (range, 1-6); 49.5% received antiprogrammed death-1/programmed death ligand-1 therapy. Any-grade treatment-related adverse events occurred in 97 patients (90.7%) and grade b % 3 in 33 patients (30.8%). One patient (1%) had grade 5 pneumonitis. Cytokine release syndrome was the most common treatment-related adverse event, occurring in 56 patients (52%) including grade 3 in one patient (1%). Maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Objective response rate was 23.4% (95% CI, 15.7 to 32.5) including two complete and 23 partial responses. The median duration of response was 12.3 months (95% CI, 6.6 to 14.9). The disease control rate was 51.4% (95% CI, 41.5 to 61.2). The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 5.4) and 13.2 months (95% CI, 10.5 to not reached), respectively. Exploratory analysis suggests that selecting for increased DLL3 expression can result in increased clinical benefit.

Conclusion: In patients with heavily pretreated SCLC, tarlatamab demonstrated manageable safety with encouraging response durability. Further evaluation of this promising molecule is ongoing.",2023-6-1,JCO.22.02823,[]

Patients and Methods: In this first-in-human phase I study, patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas received milademetan orally once daily as extended/continuous (days 1-21 or 1-28 every 28 days) or intermittent (days 1-7, or days 1-3 and 15-17 every 28 days) schedules. The primary objective was to determine the recommended phase II dose and schedule. Secondary objectives included tumor response according to standard evaluation criteria. Predefined analyses by tumor type were performed. Safety and efficacy analyses included all patients who received milademetan.

Results: Between July 2013 and August 2018, 107 patients were enrolled and received milademetan. The most common grade 3/4 drug-related adverse events were thrombocytopenia (29.0%), neutropenia (15.0%), and anemia (13.1%). Respective rates at the recommended dose and schedule (260 mg once daily on days 1-3 and 15-17 every 28 days, ie, 3/14 days) were 15.0%, 5.0%, and 0%. Across all cohorts (N = 107), the disease control rate was 45.8% (95% CI, 36.1 to 55.7) and median progression-free survival was 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.4 to 5.7). In the subgroup with dedifferentiated liposarcomas, the disease control rate and median progression-free survival were 58.5% (95% CI, 44.1 to 71.9) and 7.2 months overall (n = 53), and 62.0% (95% CI, 35.4 to 84.8) and 7.4 months with the recommended intermittent schedule (n = 16), respectively.

Conclusion: An intermittent dosing schedule of 3/14 days of milademetan mitigates dose-limiting hematologic abnormalities while maintaining efficacy.

The primary objective of Children's Oncology Group trial AEWS1221 was to determine if the addition of the IGF-1R monoclonal antibody ganitumab to interval-compressed chemotherapy improves event-free survival (EFS) in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic Ewing sarcoma.

Methods: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 at enrollment to standard arm (interval-compressed vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide alternating once every 2 weeks with ifosfamide/etoposide = VDC/IE) or to experimental arm (VDC/IE with ganitumab at cycle starts and as monotherapy once every 3 weeks for 6 months after conventional therapy). A planned sample size of 300 patients was projected to provide 81% power to detect an EFS hazard ratio of 0.67 or smaller for the experimental arm compared with the standard arm with a one-sided α of .025.

Results: Two hundred ninety-eight eligible patients enrolled (148 in standard arm; 150 in experimental arm). The 3-year EFS estimates were 37.4% (95% CI, 29.3 to 45.5) for the standard arm and 39.1% (95% CI, 31.3 to 46.7) for the experimental arm (stratified EFS-event hazard ratio for experimental arm 1.00; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.33; 1-sided, P = .50). The 3-year overall survival estimates were 59.5% (95% CI, 50.8 to 67.3) for the standard arm and 56.7% (95% CI, 48.3 to 64.2) for the experimental arm. More cases of pneumonitis after radiation involving thoracic fields and nominally higher rates of febrile neutropenia and ALT elevation were reported on the experimental arm.

Conclusion: Ganitumab added to interval-compressed chemotherapy did not significantly reduce the risk of EFS event in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic Ewing sarcoma, with outcomes similar to prior trials without IGF-1R inhibition or interval compression. The addition of ganitumab may be associated with increased toxicity.",2023-4-10,JCO.22.01815,"[{'Author': 'Steven G.

Preoperative Chemotherapy for Operable Colon Cancer: Mature Results of an International Randomized Controlled Trial,Dion  Morton; Matthew  Seymour; Laura  Magill; Kelly  Handley; James  Glasbey; Bengt  Glimelius; Andy  Palmer; Jenny  Seligmann; Søren  Laurberg; Keigo  Murakami; Nick  West; Philip  Quirke; Richard  Gray; on behalf of the FOxTROT Collaborative Group,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; Sweden; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; Denmark; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,"Purpose: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has potential advantages over standard postoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced colon cancer but requires formal evaluation.

Methods: Patients with radiologically staged T3-4, N0-2, M0 colon cancer were randomly allocated (2:1) to 6 weeks oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine preoperatively plus 18 postoperatively (NAC group) or 24 weeks postoperatively (control group). Patients with RAS-wildtype tumors could also be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive panitumumab or not during NAC. The primary end point was residual disease or recurrence within 2 years. Secondary outcomes included surgical morbidity, histopathologic stage, regression grade, completeness of resection, and cause-specific mortality. Log-rank analyses were by intention-to-treat.

Results: Of 699 patients allocated to NAC, 674 (96%) started and 606 (87%) completed NAC. In total, 686 of 699 (98.1%) NAC patients and 351 of 354 (99.2%) control patients underwent surgery. Thirty patients (4.3%) allocated to NAC developed obstructive symptoms requiring expedited surgery, but there were fewer serious postoperative complications with NAC than with control. NAC produced marked T and N downstaging and histologic tumor regression (all P < .001). Resection was more often histopathologically complete: 94% (648/686) versus 89% (311/351), P < .001. Fewer NAC than control patients had residual or recurrent disease within 2 years (16.9% [118/699] v 21.5% [76/354]; rate ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98]; P = .037). Tumor regression correlated strongly with freedom from recurrence. Panitumumab did not enhance the benefit from NAC. Little benefit from NAC was seen in mismatch repair–deficient tumors.

Conclusion: Six weeks of preoperative oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy for operable colon cancer can be delivered safely, without increasing perioperative morbidity. This chemotherapy regimen, when given preoperatively, produces marked histopathologic down-staging, fewer incomplete resections, and better 2-year disease control. Histologic regression after NAC is a strong predictor of lower postoperative recurrence risk so has potential use as a guide for postoperative therapy. Six weeks of NAC should be considered as a treatment option for locally advanced colon cancer.",2023-3-10,JCO.22.00046,"[{'Author': 'Matthew Seymour', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Amgen (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Bengt Glimelius', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: PledPharma', 'Research Funding: Amgen']}, {'Author': 'Jenny Seligmann', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Pierre Fabre, Merck Serono, SERVIER', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Pierre Fabre, Zentalis', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bristol Myers Squibb/Medarex']}, {'Author': 'Nick West', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb, Astellas Pharma']}, {'Author': 'Philip Quirke', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Adlai Nortye, Avacta Life Sciences, Amgen, Bayer, Colonode', 'Research Funding: Roche, GeneFirst, ONI', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Roche have filed a patent jointly with my University I may receive income but none to date (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche, Bayer, Amgen', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"
Interferon Alfa-2b Adjuvant Therapy of High-Risk Resected Cutaneous Melanoma: The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trial EST 1684,J M Kirkwood; M H Strawderman; M S Ernstoff; T J Smith; E C Borden; R H Blum,USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.,"Purpose: Interferon alfa-2b (IFN alpha-2b) exhibits antitumor activity in metastatic melanoma and on this basis has been evaluated as an adjuvant therapy following surgery for deep primary (T4) or regionally metastatic (N1) melanoma.

Methods: A randomized controlled study of IFN alpha-2b (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) administered at maximum-tolerated doses of 20 MU/m2/d intravenously (i.v.) for 1 month and 10 MU/m2 three times per week subcutaneously (SC) for 48 weeks versus observation, was conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) in 287 patients.

Results: A significant prolongation of relapse-free survival (P = .0023, one-sided) and prolongation of overall survival (P = .0237, one-sided) was observed with IFN alpha-2b therapy in this trial, which is now mature with a median follow-up time of 6.9 years. The impact of treatment on relapse rate is most pronounced early during the treatment interval. The overall benefit of treatment in this trial was analyzed stratified by tumor burden and the presence or absence of microscopic nonpalpable and palpable regional lymph node metastasis. The benefit of therapy with IFN alpha-2b was greatest among node-positive strata. Toxicity of IFN alpha-2b required dose modification in the majority of patients, but treatment at > or = 80% of the scheduled dose was feasible in the majority of patients through the IV phase of treatment, and for more than 3 months of SC maintenance therapy. Discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity was infrequent after the fourth month of therapy.

Conclusion: IFN alpha-2b prolongs the relapse-free interval and overall survival of high-risk resected melanoma patients. The increment in median disease-free survival (from 1 to 1.7 years) and overall survival (from 2.8 to 3.8 years) that results from this therapy is associated with a 42% improvement in the fraction of patients who are continuously disease-free after treatment with IFN (from 26% to 37%) in comparison to observation. IFN alpha-2b is the first agent to show a significant benefit in relapse-free and overall survival of high-risk melanoma patients in a randomized controlled trial.",2023-1-20,JCO.22.02264,[]
Evaluation of the Sensitivity to Endocrine Therapy Index and 21-Gene Breast Recurrence Score in the SWOG S8814 Trial,Corey W.  Speers; W. Fraser  Symmans; William E.

We tested whether combined results from RS and the sensitivity to endocrine therapy (SET2,3) index of endocrine-related transcription (SETER/PR) adjusted for baseline prognostic index (BPI) improve prognostic assessment, and whether SET2,3 predicted benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

Methods: A blinded retrospective clinical validation of SET2,3 in two randomized treatment arms from the SWOG S8814 trial comparing adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by tamoxifen endocrine therapy for 5 years, versus tamoxifen alone. SET2,3 assay was calibrated and measured using whole-transcriptome RNA sequence of tumor samples already tested for RS. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS).

Results: There were 106 events in 283 patients over a median follow-up of 8.99 years. Proportional hazards assumptions were met during the first 5 years only. SET2,3 index and RS were not correlated (r = –0.04) and were independently prognostic (SET2,3: hazard ratio [HR], 0.48 per unit; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.68; P < .001; RS: HR, 1.28 per 10 units; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.44; P < .001). SET2,3 index did not predict chemotherapy benefit (interaction P = .77). SET2,3 was high in 93/175 (53%) patients with RS ≤ 25 (concordant low-risk), with 5-year DFS 97%. SET2,3 was low in 55/108 (51%) patients with RS > 25 (concordant high-risk), with 5-year DFS 53%. Both components of SET2,3 index were prognostic after adjustment for RS: SETER/PR (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.92) and BPI (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.64).

Conclusion: SET2,3 index was not correlated with RS, demonstrated additive prognostic performance, and was not chemopredictive in this subset of patients from S8814.

Less than 30% of survivors currently complete recommended skin cancer screening.

Patients and Methods: This randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial evaluated patient and provider activation (PAE + MD) and patient and provider activation with teledermoscopy (PAE + MD + TD) compared with patient activation alone (PAE), which included print materials, text messaging, and a website on skin cancer risk factors and screening behaviors. Seven hundred twenty-eight participants from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (median age at baseline 44 years), age > 18 years, treated with radiotherapy as children, and without previous history of skin cancer were randomly assigned (1:1:1). Primary outcomes included receiving a physician skin examination at 12 months and conducting a skin self-examination at 18 months after intervention.

Results: Rates of physician skin examinations increased significantly from baseline to 12 months in all three intervention groups: PAE, 24%-39%, relative risk [RR], 1.65, 95% CI, 1.32 to 2.08; PAE + MD, 24% to 39%, RR, 1.56, 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.97; PAE + MD + TD, 24% to 46%, RR, 1.89, 95% CI, 1.51 to 2.37. The increase in rates did not differ between groups (P = .49). Similarly, rates of skin self-examinations increased significantly from baseline to 18 months in all three groups: PAE, 29% to 50%, RR, 1.75, 95% CI, 1.42 to 2.16; PAE + MD, 31% to 58%, RR, 1.85, 95% CI, 1.52 to 2.26; PAE + MD + TD, 29% to 58%, RR, 1.95, 95% CI, 1.59 to 2.40, but the increase in rates did not differ between groups (P = .43).

Conclusion: Although skin cancer screening rates increased more than 1.5-fold in each of the intervention groups, there were no differences between groups. Any of these interventions, if implemented, could improve skin cancer prevention behaviors among childhood cancer survivors.",2023-4-20,JCO.22.00408,[]

Here, we report the 5-year results for cosmetic outcomes and toxicity of the IRMA trial.

Methods: We ran this randomized phase III trial in 35 centers. Women with stage I-IIA breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery, age ≥ 49 years, were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either whole-breast irradiation (WBI) or external beam radiation therapy APBI (38.5 Gy/10 fraction twice daily). Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary end point was ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence. We hereby present the analysis of the secondary outcomes, cosmesis, and normal tissue toxicity. All side effects were graded with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema. Analysis was performed with both intention-to-treat and as-treated approaches.

Results: Between March 2007 and March 2019, 3,309 patients were randomly assigned to 1,657 WBI and 1,652 APBI; 3,225 patients comprised the intention-to-treat population (1,623 WBI and 1,602 APBI). At a median follow-up of 5.6 (interquartile range, 4.0-8.4) years, adverse cosmesis in the APBI patients was higher than that in the WBI patients at 3 years (12.7% v 9.2%; P = .009) and at 5 years (14% v 9.8%; P = .012). Late soft tissue toxicity (grade ≥ 3: 2.8% APBI v 1% WBI, P < .0001) and late bone toxicity (grade ≥ 3: 1.1% APBI v 0% WBI, P < .0001) were significantly higher in the APBI arm. There were no significant differences in late skin and lung toxicities.

Conclusion: External beam radiation therapy-APBI with a twice-daily IRMA schedule was associated with increased rates of late moderate soft tissue and bone toxicities, with a slight decrease in patient-reported cosmetic outcomes at 5 years when compared with WBI, although overall toxicity was in an acceptable range.",2023-4-20,JCO.22.01485,"[{'Author': 'Bruno Meduri', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: MSD (I), Nestle Health Science (I)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Ipsen, AstraZeneca (I), Janssen (I), Merck (I)']}, {'Author': 'Frank Lohr', 'Disclosures': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Elekta']}, {'Author': 'Philip Poortmans', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Sordina IORT Technologies spa', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

Methods: This is a phase II open-label, single-center trial of localized unresectable or high-risk resectable MSI-H/dMMR tumors. Treatment is pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 6 months followed by surgical resection with an option to continue therapy for 1 year followed by observation. To continue on study, patients are required to have radiographic or clinical benefit. The coprimary end points are safety and pathologic complete response. Key secondary end points are response rate and organ-sparing at one year for patients who declined surgery. Exploratory analyses include interrogation of the tumor immune microenvironment using imaging mass cytometry.

Results: A total of 35 patients were enrolled, including 27 patients with colorectal cancer and eight patients with noncolorectal cancer. Among 33 evaluable patients, best overall response rate was 82%. Among 17 (49%) patients who underwent surgery, the pathologic complete response rate was 65%. Ten patients elected to receive one year of pembrolizumab followed by surveillance without surgical resection (median follow-up of 23 weeks [range, 0-54 weeks]). An additional eight did not undergo surgical resection and received less than 1 year of pembrolizumab. During the study course of the trial and subsequent follow-up, progression events were seen in six patients (four of whom underwent salvage surgery). There were no new safety signals. Spatial immune profiling with imaging mass cytometry noted a significantly closer proximity between granulocytic cells and cytotoxic T cells in patients with progressive events compared with those without progression.

Conclusion: Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in dMMR/MSI-H cancers is safe and resulted in high rates of pathologic, radiographic, and endoscopic response, which has implications for organ-sparing strategies.",2023-4-20,JCO.22.01351,"[{'Author': 'Kaysia Ludford', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Merck (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Won Jin Ho', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Standard Biotools', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Exelixis', 'Research Funding: Sanofi (Inst), NeoTX (Inst)', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: I hold patents and receive royalties from Rodeo Therapeutics']}, {'Author': 'Kanwal P.S.

Whether increasing radiotherapy dose improves outcomes remains to be prospectively demonstrated.

Methods: This phase III trial, CALGB 30610/RTOG 0538 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00632853), was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, patients with limited-stage disease were randomly assigned to receive 45-Gy twice-daily, 70-Gy once-daily, or 61.2-Gy concomitant-boost radiotherapy, starting with either the first or second (of four total) chemotherapy cycles. In the second stage, allocation to the 61.2-Gy arm was discontinued following planned interim toxicity analysis, and the study continued with two remaining arms. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat population.

Results: Trial accrual opened on March 15, 2008, and closed on December 1, 2019. All patients randomly assigned to 45-Gy twice-daily (n = 313) or 70-Gy once-daily radiotherapy (n = 325) are included in this analysis. After a median follow-up of 4.7 years, OS was not improved on the once-daily arm (hazard ratio for death, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.17; P = .594). Median survival is 28.5 months for twice-daily treatment, and 30.1 months for once-daily treatment, with 5-year OS of 29% and 32%, respectively. Treatment was tolerable, and the frequency of severe adverse events, including esophageal and pulmonary toxicity, was similar on both arms.

Conclusion: Although 45-Gy twice-daily radiotherapy remains the standard of care, this study provides the most robust information available to help guide the choice of thoracic radiotherapy regimen for patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer.",2023-5-1,JCO.22.01359,"[{'Author': 'Jeffrey Bogart', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Cardan Robotics, Verve Medical']}, {'Author': 'Laurie E.

Methods: Patients (age ≥ 12 years) with newly diagnosed moderate or severe cGVHD, requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy, and with no prior systemic treatment for cGVHD were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive ibrutinib 420 mg once daily plus prednisone, starting at 1 mg/kg once daily or placebo plus prednisone. The primary end point was response rate at 48 weeks according to 2014 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Project Criteria. Other end points included event-free survival, duration of response, time to withdrawal of immunosuppressants, improvement in Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale score, overall survival (OS), and safety.

Results: Ninety-five and 98 patients enrolled in the ibrutinib-prednisone and placebo-prednisone arms, respectively. At 48 weeks, response rates were 41% (ibrutinib-prednisone) and 37% (placebo-prednisone; P = .54). At 33 months of follow-up, median duration of response was 19 months (ibrutinib-prednisone) and 10 months (placebo-prednisone; P = .10). Median event-free survival was 15 months (ibrutinib-prednisone) and 8 months (placebo-prednisone; hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.1; P = .11). Improvement in overall Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale was 43% (ibrutinib-prednisone) and 31% (placebo-ibrutinib; P = .07). Median OS was not reached in either arm. The 24-month Kaplan-Meier OS estimates were 80% for both arms (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.90). Grade ≥ 3 serious adverse events occurred in 49% (ibrutinib-prednisone) and 47% (placebo-prednisone) of patients.

Conclusion: There was no statistical difference observed in the primary and secondary end points with ibrutinib-prednisone treatment. No new safety signals were observed with ibrutinib treatment in previously untreated patients with cGVHD.

It is appealing for targeted therapy, because it does not shed or modulate. A chimeric monoclonal antibody more effectively mediates host effector functions and is itself less immunogenic than are murine antibodies.

Patients and Methods: This was a multiinstitutional trial of the chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, IDEC-C2B8. Patients with relapsed low grade or follicular lymphoma received an outpatient treatment course of IDEC-C2B8 375 mg/m2 intravenously weekly for four doses.

Results: From 31 centers, 166 patients were entered. Of this intent-to-treat group, 48% responded. With a median follow-up duration of 11.8 months, the projected median time to progression for responders is 13.0 months. Serum antibody levels were sustained longer after the fourth infusion than after the first, and were higher in responders and in patients with lower tumor burden. The majority of adverse events occurred during the first infusion and were grade 1 or 2; fever and chills were the most common events. Only 12% of patients had grade 3 and 3% grade 4 toxicities. A human antichimeric antibody was detected in only one patient.

Conclusion: The response rate of 48% with IDEC-C2B8 is comparable to results with single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy. Toxicity was mild. Attention needs to be paid to the rate of antibody infusion, with titration according to toxicity. Further investigation of this agent is warranted, including its use in conjunction with standard chemotherapy.",2023-1-10,JCO.22.02403,[]

We conducted a multicenter, single-arm, phase II trial of NAC with gemcitabine and split-dose cisplatin (GC) for patients with high-risk UTUC before extirpative surgery to evaluate response, survival, and tolerability.

Methods: Eligible patients with defined criteria for high-risk localized UTUC received four cycles of split-dose GC before surgical resection and lymph node dissection. The primary study end point was rate of pathologic response (defined as < ypT2N0). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety and tolerability.

Results: Among 57 patients evaluated, 36 (63%) demonstrated pathologic response (95% CI, 49 to 76). A complete pathologic response (ypT0N0) was noted in 11 patients (19%). Fifty-one patients (89%) tolerated at least three complete cycles of split-dose GC, 27 patients (47%) tolerated four complete cycles, and all patients proceeded to surgery. With a median follow up of 3.1 years, 2- and 5-year PFS rates were 89% (95% CI, 81 to 98) and 72% (95% CI, 59 to 87), while 2- and 5-year OS rates were 93% (95% CI, 86 to 100) and 79% (95% CI, 67 to 94), respectively. Pathologic complete and partial responses were associated with improved PFS and OS compared with nonresponders (≥ ypT2N any; 2-year PFS 100% and 95% v 76%, P < .001; 2-year OS 100% and 100% v 80%, P < .001).

Conclusion: NAC with split-dose GC for high-risk UTUC is a well-tolerated, effective therapy demonstrating evidence of pathologic response that is associated with favorable survival outcomes. Given that these survival outcomes are superior to historical series, these data support the use of NAC as a standard of care for high-risk UTUC, and split-dose GC is a viable option for NAC.",2023-3-10,JCO.22.00763,"[{'Author': 'Jonathan A.

Methods: In a 20-year retrospective cohort of 392 patients with IDH-mutant grade 2 glioma, we analyzed the combined effects of volumetric EOR and molecular and clinical factors on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival by recursive partitioning analysis. The OS results were validated in two external cohorts (n = 365). Propensity score analysis of the combined cohorts (n = 757) was used to mimic a randomized clinical trial with varying levels of EOR.

Results: Recursive partitioning analysis identified three survival risk groups. Median OS was shortest in two subsets of patients with astrocytoma: those with postoperative tumor volume (TV) > 4.6 mL and those with preoperative TV > 43.1 mL and postoperative TV ≤ 4.6 mL. Intermediate OS was seen in patients with astrocytoma who had chemotherapy with preoperative TV ≤ 43.1 mL and postoperative TV ≤ 4.6 mL in addition to oligodendroglioma patients with either preoperative TV > 43.1 mL and residual TV ≤ 4.6 mL or postoperative residual volume > 4.6 mL. Longest OS was seen in astrocytoma patients with preoperative TV ≤ 43.1 mL and postoperative TV ≤ 4.6 mL who received no chemotherapy and oligodendroglioma patients with preoperative TV ≤ 43.1 mL and postoperative TV ≤ 4.6 mL. EOR ≥ 75% improved survival outcomes, as shown by propensity score analysis.

Conclusion: Across both subtypes of LGG, EOR beginning at 75% improves OS while beginning at 80% improves progression-free survival. Nonetheless, maximal resection with preservation of neurological function remains the treatment goal.

Single-agent epcoritamab previously demonstrated potent antitumor activity in dose escalation across B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes.

Patients and Methods: In the dose-expansion cohort of a phase I/II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03625037), adults with relapsed or refractory CD20+ large B-cell lymphoma and at least two prior therapy lines (including anti-CD20 therapies) received subcutaneous epcoritamab in 28-day cycles (once weekly step-up doses in weeks 1-3 of cycle 1, then full doses once weekly through cycle 3, once every 2 weeks in cycles 4-9, and once every 4 weeks in cycle 10 and thereafter) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was overall response rate by the independent review committee.

Results: As of January 31, 2022, 157 patients were treated (median age, 64 years [range, 20‐83]; median of three [range, 2-11] prior therapy lines; primary refractory disease: 61.1%; prior chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell exposure: 38.9%). At a median follow-up of 10.7 months, the overall response rate was 63.1% (95% CI, 55.0 to 70.6) and the complete response rate was 38.9% (95% CI, 31.2 to 46.9). The median duration of response was 12.0 months (among complete responders: not reached). Overall and complete response rates were similar across key prespecified subgroups. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (49.7%; grade 1 or 2: 47.1%; grade 3: 2.5%), pyrexia (23.6%), and fatigue (22.9%). Immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 6.4% of patients with one fatal event.

Patients and Methods: In this randomized, open-label, multicenter trial, histologically confirmed HCC patients with MVI were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive adjuvant FOLFOX-HAIC (treatment group) or routine follow-up (control group). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis while secondary end points were overall survival, recurrence rate, and safety.

Results: Between June 2016 and August 2021, a total of 315 patients (ITT population) at five centers were randomly assigned to the treatment group (n = 157) or the control group (n = 158). In the ITT population, the median DFS was 20.3 months (95% CI, 10.4 to 30.3) in the treatment group versus 10.0 months (95% CI, 6.8 to 13.2) in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.81; P = .001). The overall survival rates at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 93.8% (95% CI, 89.8 to 98.1), 86.4% (95% CI, 80.0 to 93.2), and 80.4% (95% CI, 71.9 to 89.9) for the treatment group and 92.0% (95% CI, 87.6 to 96.7), 86.0% (95% CI, 79.9 to 92.6), and 74.9% (95% CI, 65.5 to 85.7) for the control group (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.14; P = .130), respectively. The recurrence rates were 40.1% (63/157) in the treatment group and 55.7% (88/158) in the control group. Majority of the adverse events were grade 0-1 (83.8%), with no treatment-related death in both groups.

Conclusion: Postoperative adjuvant HAIC with FOLFOX significantly improved the DFS benefits with acceptable toxicities in HCC patients with MVI.",2023-4-1,JCO.22.01142,[]

SurVaxM is a peptide vaccine conjugate that has been shown to activate the immune system against its target molecule survivin, which is highly expressed by glioblastoma cells. We conducted a phase IIa, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating the safety, immunologic effects, and survival of patients with nGBM receiving SurVaxM plus adjuvant TMZ following surgery and chemoradiation (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02455557).

Methods: Sixty-four patients with resected nGBM were enrolled including 38 men and 26 women, in the age range of 20-82 years. Following craniotomy and fractionated radiation therapy with concurrent TMZ, patients received four doses of SurVaxM (500 μg once every 2 weeks) in Montanide ISA-51 plus sargramostim (granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) subcutaneously. Patients subsequently received adjuvant TMZ and maintenance SurVaxM concurrently until progression. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were reported. Immunologic responses to SurVaxM were assessed.

Results: SurVaxM plus TMZ was well tolerated with no serious adverse events attributable to SurVaxM. Of the 63 patients who were evaluable for outcome, 60 (95.2%) remained progression-free 6 months after diagnosis (prespecified primary end point). Median PFS was 11.4 months and median OS was 25.9 months measured from first dose of SurVaxM. SurVaxM produced survivin-specific CD8+ T cells and antibody/immunoglobulin G titers. Apparent clinical benefit of SurVaxM was observed in both methylated and unmethylated patients.

Conclusion: SurVaxM appeared to be safe and well tolerated. The combination represents a promising therapy for nGBM. For patients with nGBM treated in this manner, PFS may be an acceptable surrogate for OS.

Methods: We assigned 866 treatment-naive patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) + gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2) or gemcitabine alone to one 30-40 infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of six 28-day cycles. The primary end point was independently assessed disease-free survival (DFS). Additional end points included investigator-assessed DFS, overall survival (OS), and safety.

Results: Two hundred eighty-seven of 432 patients and 310 of 434 patients completed nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine and gemcitabine treatment, respectively. At primary data cutoff (December 31, 2018; median follow-up, 38.5 [interquartile range [IQR], 33.8-43 months), the median independently assessed DFS was 19.4 (nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine) versus 18.8 months (gemcitabine; hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.729 to 1.063; P = .18). The median investigator-assessed DFS was 16.6 (IQR, 8.4-47.0) and 13.7 (IQR, 8.3-44.1) months, respectively (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.694 to 0.965; P = .02). The median OS (427 events; 68% mature) was 40.5 (IQR, 20.7 to not reached) and 36.2 (IQR, 17.7-53.3) months, respectively (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.680 to 0.996; P = .045). At a 16-month follow-up (cutoff, April 3, 2020; median follow-up, 51.4 months [IQR, 47.0-57.0]), the median OS (511 events; 81% mature) was 41.8 (nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine) versus 37.7 months (gemcitabine; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.687 to 0.973; P = .0232). At the 5-year follow-up (cutoff, April 9, 2021; median follow-up, 63.2 months [IQR, 60.1-68.7]), the median OS (555 events; 88% mature) was 41.8 versus 37.7 months, respectively (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.678 to 0.947; P = .0091). Eighty-six percent (nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine) and 68% (gemcitabine) of patients experienced grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events. Two patients per study arm died of treatment-emergent adverse events.

Conclusion: The primary end point (independently assessed DFS) was not met despite favorable OS seen with nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine.",2023-4-10,JCO.22.01134,"[{'Author': 'Margaret A.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

The combined analysis of SOFT-TEXT compared outcomes in 4,690 premenopausal women with estrogen/progesterone receptor–positive (ER/PgR+) early breast cancer randomly assigned to 5 years of exemestane + ovarian function suppression (OFS) versus tamoxifen + OFS. After a median follow-up of 9 years, exemestane + OFS significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) and distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI), but not overall survival, compared with tamoxifen + OFS. We now report DFS, DRFI, and overall survival after a median follow-up of 13 years. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the 12-year DFS (4.6% absolute improvement, hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.90; P < .001) and DRFI (1.8% absolute improvement, HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.98; P = .03), but not overall survival (90.1% v 89.1%, HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.11), continued to be significantly improved for patients assigned exemestane + OFS over tamoxifen + OFS. Among patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative tumors (86.0% of the ITT population), the absolute improvement in 12-year overall survival with exemestane + OFS was 2.0% (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.04) and 3.3% in those who received chemotherapy (45.9% of the ITT population). Overall survival benefit was clinically significant in high-risk patients, eg, women age < 35 years (4.0%) and those with > 2 cm (4.5%) or grade 3 tumors (5.5%). These sustained reductions of the risk of recurrence with adjuvant exemestane + OFS, compared with tamoxifen + OFS, provide guidance for selecting patients for whom exemestane should be preferred over tamoxifen in the setting of OFS.

Methods: In cohort 6 of the multicohort, open-label, phase I/II CheckMate 040 study, patients who were treatment-naive, sorafenib-intolerant, or had progressed on sorafenib were randomly assigned 1:1 to nivolumab 240 mg once every 2 weeks plus cabozantinib 40 mg once daily (doublet arm); or nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus cabozantinib 40 mg once daily with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg once every 6 weeks (triplet arm). Primary objectives were safety and tolerability, objective response rate, and duration of response by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1. Secondary objectives included progression-free survival (by blinded independent central review) and overall survival.

Results: Seventy-one patients were randomly assigned: 36 to the doublet arm and 35 to the triplet arm. After 32.0-month median follow-up, objective response rate (95% CI) was 17% (6 to 33) and 29% (15 to 46) in the doublet and triplet arms, respectively. Median (95% CI) duration of response was 8.3 (6.9 to not estimable) months in the doublet arm and not reached (0.0 to not estimable) in the triplet arm. Median progression-free survival was 5.1 and 4.3 months, and median overall survival was 20.2 and 22.1 months for the doublet and triplet arms, respectively. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 50% and 74% of patients and treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported for 11% and 23% in the doublet and triplet arms, respectively. There were no treatment-related deaths in either arm.

Conclusion: Nivolumab plus cabozantinib with or without ipilimumab showed encouraging preliminary antitumor activity and had consistent safety profiles with those established for the individual drugs in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.",2023-3-20,JCO.22.00972,"[{'Author': 'Thomas Yau', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Bristol Myers Squibb, MSD Oncology, AstraZeneca', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb']}, {'Author': 'Vittorina Zagonel', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Mundipharma', ""Speakers' Bureau: Bayer, Merck, Astellas Pharma"", 'Research Funding: Bayer (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Daiichi Sankyo/Lilly']}, {'Author': 'Armando Santoro', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb, Servier, Gilead Sciences, Pfizer, Eisai, Bayer, MSD, Sanofi, ARQULE, Incyte', ""Speakers' Bureau: Takeda, Roche, AbbVie, Amgen, Celgene, AstraZeneca, ArQule, Lilly, Sandoz, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, Servier, Gilead Sciences, Pfizer, Eisai, Bayer, MSD""]}, {'Author': 'Mirelis Acosta-Rivera', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Merck', ""Speakers' Bureau: Merck, Eisai, Bristol Myers Squibb""]}, {'Author': 'Su Pin Choo', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene', 'Honoraria: Bristol Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca, Ipsen, Eisai, Roche', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca, Bayer, MSD Oncology, Eisai, Roche', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Taiho Pharmaceutical, Bristol Myers Squibb']}, {'Author': 'Ana Matilla', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca Spain, Roche, Sirtex Medical', ""Speakers' Bureau: Roche, Boston Scientific, Gilead Sciences""]}, {'Author': 'Aiwu Ruth He', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Merck, Genentech/Roche, Eisai', ""Speakers' Bureau: Eisai, Bristol Myers Squibb, Exelixis"", 'Research Funding: Genentech, Merck']}, {'Author': 'Anthony B.

Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

In the investigator-sponsored randomized phase II NIVAHL trial for early-stage unfavorable classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), two schedules of four cycles of nivolumab, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine followed by 30 Gy involved-site radiotherapy resulted in high complete remission rates and an unprecedented 1-year progression-free survival in 109 patients. In this article, we report the preplanned final analysis conducted three years after the registration of the last patient including long-term safety results. No survival events were observed since the primary analysis, and after a median follow-up (FU) of 41 months, the overall survival was 100% in both treatment groups. The progression-free survival was 98% and 100% in the sequential and concomitant nivolumab, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine treatment groups, respectively. At last FU, the mean forced expiratory pressure in one second was 95.5% (standard deviation 12.7%), the mean diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide adjusted for hemoglobin was 82.8% (standard deviation 15.4%), and the left ventricular ejection fraction was in the normal range in 95% of patients. Hypothyroidism requiring long-term medication occurred in 15% of patients, who were nearly exclusively female (87%). No second primary malignancies occurred, and no patient required corticosteroid treatment at last FU.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

The Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00066690) randomly assigned premenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer to 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression (OFS), or exemestane plus OFS. The primary analysis compared disease-free survival (DFS) between tamoxifen plus OFS versus tamoxifen alone; exemestane plus OFS versus tamoxifen was a secondary objective. After 8 years, SOFT reported a significant reduction in recurrence and improved overall survival (OS) with adjuvant tamoxifen plus OFS versus tamoxifen alone. Here, we report outcomes after median follow-up of 12 years. DFS remained significantly improved with tamoxifen plus OFS versus tamoxifen (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.98) with a 12-year DFS of 71.9% with tamoxifen, 76.1% with tamoxifen plus OFS, and 79.0% with exemestane plus OFS. OS was improved with tamoxifen plus OFS versus tamoxifen (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.01) and was 86.8% with tamoxifen, 89.0% with tamoxifen plus OFS, and 89.4% with exemestane plus OFS at 12 years. Among those who received prior chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2–negative tumors, OS was 78.8% with tamoxifen, 81.1% with tamoxifen plus OFS, and 84.4% with exemestane plus OFS. In conclusion, after 12 years, there remains a benefit from including OFS in adjuvant endocrine therapy, with an absolute improvement in OS more apparent with higher baseline risk of recurrence.

Mepitel film (MF) can reduce RD, but the results from two randomized controlled trials are conflicting. We aimed to conduct a confirmatory randomized controlled trial in patients at risk of RD.

Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive MF or standard care (2:1 ratio). Patients with large breasts after lumpectomy (bra size ≥ 36 inches or cup size ≥ C) or after mastectomy were eligible. Stratification factors included surgery type, dose fractionation, and administration of boost/bolus. The primary end point was grade (G) 2 or 3 RD using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. Secondary end points included patient- and clinician-reported outcomes.

Results: Between January 2020 and May 2022, 376 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The incidence of G2 or 3 RD was significantly lower in MF patients compared with standard care (n = 39/251, 15.5%; 95% CI, 11.3 to 20.6% v n = 57/125, 45.6%; 95% CI, 36.7 to 54.8% respectively, odds ratio (OR): 0.20, P < .0001). Benefits of MF remained significant in patients who developed G 3 RD (n = 7, 2.8%; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.7% v n = 17, 13.6%; 95% CI, 8.1 to 20.9%, OR: 0.19) and moist desquamation (n = 20, 8.0%; 95% CI, 4.9 to 12.0% v n = 24, 19.2%; 95% CI, 12.7 to 27.1%, OR: 0.36). When evaluating the combined patient and health care provider score using Radiation-Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale, the MF arm had significantly lower scores (P < .0001). Individual items on the Radiation-Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale also favored the MF for both patient- and clinician-reported outcomes. Blistering/peeling, erythema, pigmentation, and edema were significantly reduced in the MF arm. Three patients removed the film prematurely because of rash (n = 2) and excessive pruritus (n = 1).

Conclusion: MF significantly reduces RD in patients undergoing breast radiotherapy.",2023-2-20,JCO.22.01873,"[{'Author': 'Irene Karam', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Pfizer', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Elekta']}, {'Author': 'Eileen Rakovitch', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca', 'Research Funding: Genomic Health International']}, {'Author': 'Danny Vesprini', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Merck, Elekta', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca Canada']}, {'Author': 'Hanbo Chen', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Novartis']}, {'Author': 'Chris Lavoie', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Galera Therapeutics']}, {'Author': 'Gina Wong', 'Disclosures': ['Other Relationship: Mölnlycke (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Katherine Carothers', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Pfizer', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

Methods: Patients without prior systemic therapy for R/M SCCHN were randomly assigned 1:1 to nivolumab plus ipilimumab or EXTREME. Primary end points were overall survival (OS) in the all randomly assigned and programmed death-ligand 1 combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 20 populations. Secondary end points included OS in the programmed death-ligand 1 CPS ≥ 1 population, and progression-free survival, objective response rate, and duration of response in the all randomly assigned and CPS ≥ 20 populations.

Results: Among 947 patients randomly assigned, 38.3% had CPS ≥ 20. There were no statistically significant differences in OS with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus EXTREME in the all randomly assigned (median: 13.9 v 13.5 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.95; 97.9% CI, 0.80 to 1.13; P = .4951) and CPS ≥ 20 (median: 17.6 v 14.6 months; HR, 0.78; 97.51% CI, 0.59 to 1.03; P = .0469) populations. In patients with CPS ≥ 1, the median OS was 15.7 versus 13.2 months (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.97). Among patients with CPS ≥ 20, the median progression-free survival was 5.4 months (nivolumab plus ipilimumab) versus 7.0 months (EXTREME), objective response rate was 34.1% versus 36.0%, and median duration of response was 32.6 versus 7.0 months. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 28.2% of patients treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 70.7% treated with EXTREME.

Conclusion: CheckMate 651 did not meet its primary end points of OS in the all randomly assigned or CPS ≥ 20 populations.

Thus, we conducted this phase II study to assess the antitumor activity of adavosertib in patients with CCNE1-amplified, advanced refractory solid tumors.

Patients and Methods: Patients aged ≥ 18 years with measurable disease and refractory solid tumors harboring CCNE1 amplification, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and adequate organ function were studied. Patients received 300 mg of adavosertib once daily on days 1 through 5 and 8 through 12 of a 21-day cycle. The trial followed Bayesian optimal phase II design. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR).

Results: Thirty patients were enrolled. The median follow-up duration was 9.9 months. Eight patients had partial responses (PRs), and three had stable disease (SD) ≥ 6 months, with an ORR of 27% (95% CI, 12 to 46), a SD ≥ 6 months/PR rate of 37% (95% CI, 20 to 56), a median progression-free survival duration of 4.1 months (95% CI, 1.8 to 6.4), and a median overall survival duration of 9.9 months (95% CI, 4.8 to 15). Fourteen patients with epithelial ovarian cancer showed an ORR of 36% (95% CI, 13 to 65) and SD ≥ 6 months/PR of 57% (95% CI, 29 to 82), a median progression-free survival duration of 6.3 months (95% CI, 2.4 to 10.2), and a median overall survival duration of 14.9 months (95% CI, 8.9 to 20.9). Common treatment-related toxicities were GI, hematologic toxicities, and fatigue.

Conclusion: Adavosertib monotherapy demonstrates a manageable toxicity profile and promising clinical activity in refractory solid tumors harboring CCNE1 amplification, especially in epithelial ovarian cancer.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

In 2004, the European Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) Network initiated the randomized open-label, phase III MCL Younger trial for first-line treatment of patients with advanced-stage MCL, age < 66 years, comparing an alternating rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone/rituximab plus dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-CHOP/R-DHAP) induction followed by high-dose cytarabine-containing myeloablative radiochemotherapy conditioning and autologous peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (R-DHAP arm) to R-CHOP with standard myeloablative radiochemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (R-CHOP arm). After a median follow-up of 10.6 years, the time to treatment failure was still significantly improved in the R-DHAP versus R-CHOP arms (medians 8.4 v 3.9 years, 5-/10-year rates 64%/46% v 41%/25%, P = .038, hazard ratio, 0.59). Median overall survival (OS) was not reached in the R-DHAP arm versus 11.3 years in R-CHOP arm (5-/10-year rates, 76%/60% v 69%/55%, P = .12). The unadjusted OS hazard ratios (0.80 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.06], P = .12) reached significance when adjusted for Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI) and MIPI + Ki-67 (MIPI-c) (0.74; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.98; P = .038 and .60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.87; P = .0066). The incidence of secondary hematologic malignancies tended to be higher in the R-DHAP arm (4.5% v 1.4% at 10 years). With mature long-term data, we confirm the previously observed substantially prolonged time to treatment failure and, for the first time to our knowledge, show an improvement of OS.

Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R)–dependent macrophages promote cGVHD fibrosis, and their elimination in preclinical studies ameliorated cGVHD. Axatilimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits CSF-1R signaling and restrains macrophage development.

Patients and Methods: This phase I (phI)/phase II (phII) open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03604692) evaluated safety, tolerability, and efficacy of axatilimab in patients age ≥ 6 years with active cGVHD after ≥ 2 prior systemic therapy lines. Primary objectives in phI were to identify the optimal biologic and recommended phII dose and in phII to evaluate the overall (complete and partial) response rate (ORR) at the start of treatment cycle 7.

Results: Forty enrolled patients (17 phI; 23 phII) received at least one axatilimab dose. In phI, a dose of 3 mg/kg given once every 4 weeks met the optimal biologic dose definition. Two dose-limiting toxicities occurred at the 3 mg/kg dose given once every 2 weeks. At least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) was observed in 30 patients with grade ≥ 3 TRAEs in eight patients, the majority known on-target effects of CSF-1R inhibition. No cytomegalovirus reactivations occurred. With the 50% ORR at cycle 7 day 1, the phII cohort met the primary efficacy end point. Furthermore, the ORR in the first six cycles, an end point supporting regulatory approvals, was 82%. Responses were seen in all affected organs regardless of prior therapy. Fifty-eight percent of patients reported significant improvement in cGVHD-related symptoms using the Lee Symptom Scale. On-target activity of axatilimab was suggested by the decrease in skin CSF-1R–expressing macrophages.

Conclusion: Targeting profibrotic macrophages with axatilimab is a therapeutically promising novel strategy with a favorable safety profile for refractory cGVHD.",2023-4-1,JCO.22.00958,"[{'Author': 'Carrie L.

We conducted a randomized phase III trial comparing decitabine (DAC) and HY in advanced myeloproliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML).

Patients and Methods: Newly diagnosed myeloproliferative CMML patients with advanced disease were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous DAC (20 mg/m2/d days 1-5) or HY (1-4 g/d) in 28-day cycles. The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS), events being death and acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML) transformation or progression.

Results: One-hundred seventy patients received DAC (n = 84) or HY (n = 86). Median age was 72 and 74 years, and median WBC count 32.5 × 109/L and 31.2 × 109/L in the DAC and HY arms, respectively. Thirty-three percent of DAC and 31% of HY patients had CMML-2. Patients received a median of five DAC and six HY cycles. With a median follow-up of 17.5 months, median EFS was 12.1 months in the DAC arm and 10.3 months in the HY arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.16; P = .27). There was no significant interaction between treatment effect and blast or platelet count, anemia, CMML Prognostic Scoring System, Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies, or CMML Prognostic Scoring System–mol risk. Fifty-three (63%) DAC patients achieved a response compared with 30 (35%) HY patients (P = .0004). Median duration of response was similar in both arms (DAC, 16.3 months; HY, 17.4 months; P = .90). Median overall survival was 18.4 months in the DAC arm and 21.9 months in the HY arm (P = .67). Compared with HY, DAC significantly reduced the risk of CMML progression or transformation to acute myelomonocytic leukemia (cause-specific HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.94; P = .005) at the expense of death without progression or transformation (cause-specific HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.82 to 2.9; P = .04).

Conclusion: Compared with HY, frontline treatment with DAC did not improve EFS in patients with advanced myeloproliferative CMML (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02214407).",2023-4-1,JCO.22.00437,"[{'Author': 'Raphael Itzykson', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: AbbVie, Astellas Pharma, Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, Servier', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Amgen, Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb, Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH, Novartis, Servier', 'Research Funding: Janssen (Inst), Novartis (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Valeria Santini', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, Menarini, Takeda, Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, Syros Pharmaceuticals, Servier', 'Research Funding: Celgene (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen-Cilag, Celgene']}, {'Author': 'Sylvain Thepot', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Astellas Pharma, Novartis, AbbVie, BMSi', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Amgen, AbbVie']}, {'Author': 'Lionel Ades', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Celgene, AbbVie, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, BerGenBio, Silence Therapeutics, Novartis', 'Research Funding: Celgene (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Aristoteles Giagounidis', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Novartis, Roche', 'Honoraria: Amgen, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene']}, {'Author': 'Michael Lübbert', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Syros Pharmaceuticals, AbbVie', 'Research Funding: Johnson & Johnson (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Ulrich Germing', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Celgene, Novartis, Jazz Pharmaceuticals', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Celgene', 'Research Funding: Celgene (Inst), Novartis (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Anna Maria Pelizzari', 'Disclosures': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen-Ortho']}, {'Author': 'Sophie Park', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Novartis/Ipsen, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene', 'Research Funding: Pfizer, Takeda', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer, Novartis']}, {'Author': 'Nadja Jaekel', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Novartis']}, {'Author': 'Georgia Metzgeroth', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche Pharma AG, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: GlaxoSmithKline']}, {'Author': 'Francesco Onida', 'Disclosures': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Takeda, Kyowa Kirin International, Medac']}, {'Author': 'Andrea Patriarca', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Sanofi, SOBI', ""Speakers' Bureau: Novartis Italy, Incyte""]}, {'Author': 'Aspasia Stamatoullas', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Pfizer, Janssen', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer']}, {'Author': 'Katharina Götze', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: BMS', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: BMS, AbbVie, Servier/Pfizer', 'Research Funding: BMS']}, {'Author': 'Eric Solary', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Servier (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Novartis']}, {'Author': 'Uwe Platzbecker', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Celgene/Jazz, AbbVie, Curis, Geron, Janssen', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Celgene/Jazz, Novartis, BMS GmbH & Co.

Methods: In a double-blind, phase III trial, 453 patients with advanced HCC and progression during or after treatment with or intolerance to sorafenib or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) or placebo once every 3 weeks for ≤ 35 cycles plus best supportive care. The primary end point was overall survival (one-sided significance threshold, P = .0193 [final analysis]). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR; one-sided significance threshold, P = .0134 and .0091, respectively [second interim analysis]; RECIST version 1.1, by blinded independent central review).

Results: Median overall survival was longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group (14.6 v 13.0 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.99; P = .0180).

We report updated efficacy and safety results at the final analysis for overall survival (OS).

Methods: CASTOR was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III study during which eligible patients with ≥ 1 line of prior therapy were randomly assigned to Vd (up to eight cycles) with or without daratumumab (until disease progression). After positive primary analysis and protocol amendment, patients receiving Vd were offered daratumumab monotherapy after disease progression.

Results: At a median (range) follow-up of 72.6 months (0.0-79.8), significant OS benefit was observed with D-Vd (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.92; P = .0075). Median OS was 49.6 months with D-Vd versus 38.5 months with Vd. Prespecified subgroup analyses demonstrated an OS advantage with D-Vd versus Vd for most subgroups, including patients age ≥ 65 years and patients with one or two prior lines of therapy, International Staging System stage III disease, high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, and prior bortezomib treatment. The most common (≥ 10%) grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events with D-Vd versus Vd were thrombocytopenia (46.1% v 32.9%), anemia (16.0% v 16.0%), neutropenia (13.6% v 4.6%), lymphopenia (10.3% v 2.5%), and pneumonia (10.7% v 10.1%).

Conclusion: D-Vd significantly prolonged OS in patients with RRMM, with the greatest OS benefit observed in patients with one prior line of therapy. To our knowledge, our results, together with the OS benefit observed with daratumumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in the phase III POLLUX study, demonstrate for the first time an OS benefit with daratumumab-containing regimens in RRMM (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02136134 [CASTOR]).",2023-3-10,JCO.21.02734,"[{'Author': 'Pieter Sonneveld', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Celgene, Janssen, Amgen, Karyopharm Therapeutics, CARsgen Therapeutics', 'Research Funding: Janssen (Inst), Amgen (Inst), SkylineDx (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Asher Chanan-Khan', 'Disclosures': ['Leadership: Starton Therapeutics, Cellectar', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Matthew & Asher Inc, NanoDev Therapeutics, Starton Therapeutics, Cellectar', 'Honoraria: BeiGene, Ascentage Pharma', 'Research Funding: Ascentage Pharma', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Patent on PSMB9 biomarker']}, {'Author': 'Katja Weisel', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene, Janssen-Cilag, GlaxoSmithKline (Inst), Adaptive Biotechnologies, Karyopharm Therapeutics, Takeda, Sanofi, AbbVie, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Pfizer, Celgene, Oncopeptides, Roche', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Amgen, Adaptive Biotechnologies, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen-Cilag, Karyopharm Therapeutics, Sanofi, Takeda, Oncopeptides, Roche', 'Research Funding: Amgen (Inst), Celgene (Inst), Sanofi (Inst), Janssen-Cilag (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene (Inst), GlaxoSmithKline (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Amgen, Celgene, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene, Janssen-Cilag, GlaxoSmithKline, Takeda']}, {'Author': 'Ajay K.

Methods: Participants were adults with advanced cancer and symptom distress (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale [ESAS] total score of ≥ 10/90) who received titrated CBD oil 100 mg/mL, 0.5 mL once daily to 2 mL three times a day, or matched placebo for 28 days. The primary outcome was ESAS total symptom distress score (TSDS) at day 14. Response was defined as a decrease in TSDS by ≥ 6 at day 14. Secondary outcomes were ESAS TSDS over time, individual symptom scores, patient-determined effective dose, opioid use, Global Impression of Change, depression, anxiety, quality of life, and adverse events.

Results: Of the 144 patients randomly assigned, the planned sample size of 58 participants on CBD and 63 on placebo reached the primary analysis point (day 14). The unadjusted change in TSDS from baseline to day 14 was –6.2 (standard deviation, 14.5) for placebo and –3.0 (standard deviation, 15.2) for CBD with no significant difference between arms (P = .24). Similarly, there was no detected difference in proportion of responders (placebo: 37 of 63 [58.7%], CBD: 26 of 58 [44.8%], P = .13). All components of ESAS improved (fell) over time with no difference between arms. The median dose of participant-selected CBD was 400 mg per day with no correlation with opioid dose. There was no detectable effect of CBD on quality of life, depression, or anxiety. Adverse events did not differ significantly between arms apart from dyspnea that was more common with CBD. Most participants reported feeling better or much better at days 14 (53% CBD and 65% placebo) and 28 (70% CBD and 64% placebo).

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

In the primary analysis of the global phase II ELIANA trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02435849), tisagenlecleucel provided an overall remission rate of 81% in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL), with 59% of responders remaining relapse-free at 12 months. Here, we report an update on efficacy, safety, and patient-reported quality of life in 79 pediatric and young adult patients with R/R B-ALL following a median follow-up of 38.8 months. The overall remission rate was 82%. The median event-free survival was 24 months, and the median overall survival was not reached. Event-free survival was 44% (95% CI, 31 to 57) and overall survival was 63% (95% CI, 51 to 73) at 3 years overall (most events occur within the first 2 years). The estimated 3-year relapse-free survival with and without censoring for subsequent therapy was 52% (95% CI, 37 to 66) and 48% (95% CI, 34 to 60), respectively. No new or unexpected long-term adverse events were reported. Grade 3/4 adverse events were reported in 29% of patients > 1 year after infusion; grade 3/4 infection rate did not increase > 1 year after infusion.

We hypothesized that complete/sustained BTK occupancy may improve efficacy outcomes and increased BTK specificity may minimize off-target inhibition-related toxicities.

Patients and Methods: ALPINE (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03734016) is a global, randomized, open-label phase III study of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The primary end point was investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR). The preplanned interim analysis was scheduled approximately 12 months after the first 415 patients were enrolled.

Results: Between November 1, 2018, and December 14, 2020, 652 patients were enrolled. We present the interim analysis of the first 415 enrolled patients randomly assigned to receive zanubrutinib (n = 207) or ibrutinib (n = 208). At 15 months of median follow-up, ORR (partial or complete response) was significantly higher with zanubrutinib (78.3%; 95% CI, 72.0 to 83.7) versus ibrutinib (62.5%; 95% CI, 55.5 to 69.1; two-sided P < .001). ORR was higher with zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib in subgroups with del(17p)/TP53 mutations (80.5% v 50.0%) and del(11q) (83.6% v 69.1%); 12-month progression-free survival in all patients was higher with zanubrutinib (94.9%) versus ibrutinib (84.0%; hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.69). Atrial fibrillation rate was significantly lower with zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib (2.5% v 10.1%; two-sided P = .001). Rates of cardiac events, major hemorrhages, and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation/death were lower with zanubrutinib.

Conclusion: Zanubrutinib had a significantly higher ORR, lower atrial fibrillation rate, and improved progression-free survival and overall cardiac safety profile versus ibrutinib.

At 5 years, both modalities showed excellent and comparable axillary control, with significantly less morbidity after ART. We now report the preplanned 10-year analysis of the axillary recurrence rate (ARR), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS), and an updated 5-year analysis of morbidity and quality of life.

Methods: In this open-label multicenter phase III noninferiority trial, 4,806 patients underwent SN biopsy; 1,425 were node-positive and randomly assigned to either ALND (n = 744) or ART (n = 681).

Results: Per intention-to-treat analysis, 10-year ARR cumulative incidence was 0.93% (95% CI, 0.18 to 1.68; seven events) after ALND and 1.82% (95% CI, 0.74 to 2.94; 11 events) after ART (hazard ratio [HR], 1.71; 95% CI, 0.67 to 4.39). There were no differences in OS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.52) or DFS (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.46). ALND was associated with a higher lymphedema rate in updated 5-year analyses (24.5% v 11.9%; P < .001). Quality-of-life scales did not differ by treatment through 5 years. Exploratory analysis showed a 10-year cumulative incidence of second primary cancers of 12.1% (95% CI, 9.6 to 14.9) after ART and 8.3% (95% CI, 6.3 to 10.7) after ALND.

Conclusion: This 10-year analysis confirms a low ARR after both ART and ALND with no difference in OS, DFS, and locoregional control. Considering less arm morbidity, ART is preferred over ALND for patients with SN-positive cT1-2 breast cancer.",2023-4-20,JCO.22.01565,"[{'Author': 'Yazid Belkacemi', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Saint Paul de Vence', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: MSD', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Elekta Frace']}, {'Author': 'Robert E.

Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Anti–Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Treatment–Naive Patients With Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2–Low Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma: Exploratory Cohort Results in a Phase II Trial,Kensei  Yamaguchi; Yung-Jue  Bang; Satoru  Iwasa; Naotoshi  Sugimoto; Min-Hee  Ryu; Daisuke  Sakai; Hyun Cheol  Chung; Hisato  Kawakami; Hiroshi  Yabusaki; Jeeyun  Lee; Tatsu  Shimoyama; Keun-Wook  Lee; Kaku  Saito; Yoshinori  Kawaguchi; Takahiro  Kamio; Akihito  Kojima; Masahiro  Sugihara; Kohei  Shitara,Japan; South Korea; Japan; Japan; South Korea; Japan; South Korea; Japan; Japan; South Korea; Japan; South Korea; NJ; NJ; NJ; Japan; Japan; Japan,"Purpose: To investigate efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–low gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.

Methods: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-low (cohort 1, immunohistochemistry 2+/in situ hybridization–negative; cohort 2, immunohistochemistry 1+) gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with at least two prior regimens, including fluoropyrimidine and platinum, but anti-HER2 therapy naive, received T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks. The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate by independent central review.

Results: Among 21 patients enrolled in cohort 1 and 24 enrolled in cohort 2, 19 and 21 patients, respectively, had central HER2 confirmation, received T-DXd, and had measurable tumors at baseline. The confirmed objective response rate was 26.3% (95% CI, 9.1 to 51.2) from five partial responses in cohort 1 and 9.5% (95% CI, 1.2 to 30.4) from two partial responses in cohort 2. Thirteen patients (68.4%) in cohort 1 and 12 (60.0%) in cohort 2 experienced reduced tumor size. The median overall survival was 7.8 months (95% CI, 4.7 to nonevaluable) in cohort 1 and 8.5 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 10.9) in cohort 2; the median progression-free survival was 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.7 to 7.1) and 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.3), respectively. The most common grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events in cohorts 1 and 2 were anemia (30.0% and 29.2%), decreased neutrophil count (25.0% and 29.2%), and decreased appetite (20.0% and 20.8%). Drug-related interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis occurred in one patient in each cohort (grade 1 or 2). No drug-related deaths occurred.

Efficacy and Safety of Trametinib Monotherapy or in Combination With Dabrafenib in Pediatric BRAF V600–Mutant Low-Grade Glioma,Eric  Bouffet; Birgit  Geoerger; Christopher  Moertel; James A.  Whitlock; Isabelle  Aerts; Darren  Hargrave; Lisa  Osterloh; Eugene  Tan; Jeea  Choi; Mark  Russo; Elizabeth  Fox,Canada; France; MN; Canada; France; United Kingdom; Spain; NJ; NJ; NJ; TN,"Purpose: BRAF V600 mutations occur in many childhood cancers, including approximately 20% of low-grade gliomas (LGGs). Here, we describe a phase I/II study establishing pediatric dosing and pharmacokinetics of trametinib with or without dabrafenib, as well as efficacy and safety in a disease-specific cohort with BRAF V600–mutant LGG; other cohorts will be reported elsewhere.

Methods: This is a four-part, phase I/II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02124772) in patients age < 18 years with relapsed/refractory malignancies: trametinib monotherapy dose finding (part A) and disease-specific expansion (part B), and dabrafenib + trametinib dose finding (part C) and disease-specific expansion (part D). The primary objective assessed in all patients in parts A and C was to determine pediatric dosing on the basis of steady-state pharmacokinetics. Disease-specific efficacy and safety (across parts A-D) were secondary objectives.

Results: Overall, 139 patients received trametinib (n = 91) or dabrafenib + trametinib (n = 48). Trametinib dose-limiting toxicities in > 1 patient (part A) included mucosal inflammation (n = 3) and hyponatremia (n = 2). There were no dose-limiting toxicities with combination therapy (part C). The recommended phase II dose of trametinib, with or without dabrafenib, was 0.032 mg/kg once daily for patients age < 6 years and 0.025 mg/kg once daily for patients age ≥ 6 years; dabrafenib dosing in the combination was as previously identified for monotherapy. In 49 patients with BRAF V600–mutant glioma (LGG, n = 47) across all four study parts, independently assessed objective response rates were 15% (95% CI, 1.9 to 45.4) for monotherapy (n = 13) and 25% (95% CI, 12.1 to 42.2) for combination (n = 36). Adverse event–related treatment discontinuations were more common with monotherapy (54% v 22%).

Conclusion: The trial design provided efficient evaluation of pediatric dosing, safety, and efficacy of single-agent and combination targeted therapy. Age-based and weight-based dosing of trametinib with or without dabrafenib achieved target concentrations with manageable safety and demonstrated clinical efficacy and tolerability in BRAF V600–mutant LGG.",2023-1-20,JCO.22.01000,"[{'Author': 'Eric Bouffet', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis', 'Research Funding: Roche (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Birgit Geoerger', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Boehringer Ingelheim, AZD, Novartis']}, {'Author': 'Christopher Moertel', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: OX2 Therapeutics', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Patents related to intellectual property held by OX2 Therapeutics and the University of Minnesota']}, {'Author': 'James A.

Patients and Methods: Men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after RP were enrolled into a randomized, double‐blind, phase II, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of SRT plus ENZA or placebo (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02203695). Random assignment (1:1) was stratified by center, surgical margin status (R0 v R1), PSA before salvage treatment (PSA ≥ 0.5 v < 0.5 ng/mL), and pathologic Gleason sum (7 v 8‐10). Patients were assigned to receive either ENZA 160 mg once daily or matching placebo for 6 months. After 2 months of study drug therapy, external-beam radiation (66.6‐70.2 Gy) was administered to the prostate bed (no pelvic nodes). The primary end point was FFPP in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary end points were time to local recurrence within the radiation field, metastasis‐free survival, and safety as determined by frequency and severity of adverse events.

Results: Eighty-six (86) patients were randomly assigned, with a median follow-up of 34 (range, 0-52) months. Trial arms were well balanced. The median pre-SRT PSA was 0.3 (range, 0.06-4.6) ng/mL, 56 of 86 patients (65%) had extraprostatic disease (pT3), 39 of 86 (45%) had a Gleason sum of 8-10, and 43 of 86 (50%) had positive surgical margins (R1). FFPP was significantly improved with ENZA versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.92; P = .031), and 2-year FFPP was 84% versus 66%, respectively. Subgroup analyses demonstrated differential benefit of ENZA in men with pT3 (HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.69) versus pT2 disease (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.43 to 5.47; Pinteraction = .019) and R1 (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.64) versus R0 disease (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.36 to 2.76; Pinteraction = .023). There were insufficient secondary end point events for analysis. The most common adverse events were grade 1-2 fatigue (65% ENZA v 53% placebo) and urinary frequency (40% ENZA v 49% placebo).

Conclusion: SRT plus ENZA monotherapy for 6 months in men with PSA-recurrent high-risk prostate cancer after RP is safe and delays PSA progression relative to SRT alone. The impact of ENZA on distant metastasis or survival is unknown at this time.",2023-2-20,JCO.22.01662,"[{'Author': 'Phuoc T.

Meyerhardt,CT; MA; USA; IL; Canada; OH; OH; NC; MO; WV; CA; OR; NY; MI; MA,"Purpose: We sought to evaluate the independent and interactive associations of planned treatment duration, celecoxib use, physical activity, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, and vitamin B6 with oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) among patients with stage III colon cancer enrolled in a clinical trial.

Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational study of 2,450 patients with stage III colon cancer enrolled in the CALGB/SWOG 80702 trial, randomly assigned to 6 versus 12 cycles of adjuvant fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin chemotherapy with or without 3 years of celecoxib. OIPN was reported using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) during and following completion of chemotherapy and the FACT/GOG-NTX-13 15-17 months after random assignment. Multivariate analyses were adjusted for baseline sociodemographic and clinical factors.

Results: Patients assigned to 12 treatment cycles, relative to 6, were significantly more likely to experience higher-grade CTCAE- and FACT/GOG-NTX-13-reported neuropathy and longer times to resolution, while neither celecoxib nor vitamin B6 intake attenuated OIPN. Exercising ≥ 9 MET-hours per week after treatment relative to < 9 was associated with improvements in FACT/GOG-NTX-13-reported OIPN (adjusted difference in means, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.49 to 2.45; P = .003). Compared with patients with baseline BMIs < 25, those with BMIs ≥ 25 were at significantly greater risk of developing higher-grade CTCAE-reported OIPN during (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.40; P = .05) and following completion (adjusted odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.50; P = .04) of oxaliplatin treatment. Patients with diabetes were significantly more likely to experience worse FACT/GOG-NTX-13-reported neuropathy relative to those without (adjusted difference in means, –2.0; 95% CI, –3.3 to –0.73; P = .002). There were no significant interactions between oxaliplatin treatment duration and any of these potentially modifiable exposures.

Conclusion: Lower physical activity, higher BMI, diabetes, and longer planned treatment duration, but not celecoxib use or vitamin B6 intake, may be associated with significantly increased OIPN severity.",2023-2-10,JCO.22.01637,"[{'Author': 'Qian Shi', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Chugai Pharma', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Yiviva, Boehringer Ingelheim, Regeneron, Hoosier Cancer Research Network, Kronos Bio', 'Research Funding: Celgene (Inst), Roche/Genentech (Inst), Janssen (Inst), BMS (Inst), Novartis (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Felix Couture', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis Canada Pharmaceuticals Inc']}, {'Author': 'Philip Kuebler', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Advarra']}, {'Author': 'Smitha Krishnamurthi', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Aravive (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Natera (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'DeQuincy Lewis', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Cellular Therapeutics, Verastem, Veru, Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Curis, Precision Biosciences']}, {'Author': 'Benjamin Tan', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Eisai (Inst), Exelixis (Inst), Merck Serono (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Adaptimmune (Inst), TYME (Inst), Agios (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Richard M.

This secondary analysis of a national cluster randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02054741) aims to assess the effects of a GA intervention on symptomatic toxicity measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).

Methods: From 2014 to 2019, the study enrolled patients age ≥ 70 years, with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma and ≥ 1 GA domain impairment, who were initiating a regimen with high prevalence of toxicity. Patients completed PRO-CTCAEs, including the severity of 24 symptoms (11 classified as core symptoms) at enrollment, 4-6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Symptoms were scored as grade ≥ 2 (at least moderate) and grade ≥ 3 (severe/very severe). Symptomatic toxicity was determined by an increase in severity during treatment. A generalized estimating equation model was used to assess the effects of the GA intervention on symptomatic toxicity.

Results: Mean age was 77 years (range, 70-96 years), 43% were female, and 88% were White, 59% had GI or lung cancers, and 27% received prior chemotherapy. In 706 patients who provided PRO-CTCAEs at baseline, 86.1% reported at least one moderate symptom and 49.7% reported severe/very severe symptoms at regimen initiation. In 623 patients with follow-up PRO-CTCAE data, compared with usual care, fewer patients in the GA intervention arm reported grade ≥ 2 symptomatic toxicity (overall: 88.9% v 94.8%, P = .035; core symptoms: 83.4% v 91.7%, P = .001). The results for grade ≥ 3 toxicity were comparable but not significant (P > .05).

Conclusion: In the presence of a high baseline symptom burden, a GA intervention for older patients with advanced cancer reduces patient-reported symptomatic toxicity.",2023-2-1,JCO.22.00738,"[{'Author': 'Luke Peppone', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Ajna Biosciences']}, {'Author': 'Erika Ramsdale', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Flatiron Health', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Flatiron Health']}, {'Author': 'Megan Wells', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Agenus, ADRx, Corbus Pharmaceuticals, X4 Pharma, MindMed']}, {'Author': 'Rachael Tylock', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: Ortho Clinical Diagnostics']}, {'Author': 'Kah Poh Loh', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Pfizer', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Pfizer, Seattle Genetics', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

Patients and Methods: This phase II trial enrolled 225 evaluable patients age ≤ 20 years between September 17, 2019, and December 31, 2021. We first conducted a safety run-in stage to determine the recommended dose. After interim analysis of the first 30 patients treated (27 at the recommended dose) showing that the treatment was safe and effective, the study enrolled additional patients according to the study design.

Results: Complete remission was achieved in 99.0% of the 194 patients with refractory leukemia or hematologic relapse, all negative for minimal residual disease. Their overall 12-month event-free survival (EFS) was 73.5% (95% CI, 67.3 to 80.3). Relapse occurred in 43 patients (24 with CD19+/CD22+ relapse, 16 CD19–/CD22+, one CD19–/CD22–, and two unknown). Consolidative transplantation and persistent B-cell aplasia at 6 months were associated with favorable outcomes. The 12-month EFS was 85.0% (95% CI, 77.2 to 93.6) for the 78 patients treated with transplantation and 69.2% (95% CI, 60.8 to 78.8) for the 116 nontransplanted patients (P = .03, time-dependent covariate Cox model). All 25 patients with persistent B-cell aplasia at 6 months remained in remission at 12 months. The 12-month EFS for the 20 patients with isolated testicular relapse was 95.0% (95% CI, 85.9 to 100), and for the 10 patients with isolated CNS relapse, it was 68.6% (95% CI, 44.5 to 100). Cytokine release syndrome developed in 198 (88.0%) patients, and CAR T-cell neurotoxicity in 47 (20.9%), resulting in three deaths.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

Final overall survival (OS) in SOPHIA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02492711), a study of margetuximab versus trastuzumab, both with chemotherapy, in patients with previously treated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive advanced breast cancer, is reported with updated safety. Overall, 536 patients in the intention-to-treat population were randomly assigned to margetuximab (15 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks; n = 266) plus chemotherapy or trastuzumab (6 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks after a loading dose of 8 mg/kg; n = 270) plus chemotherapy. Primary end points were progression-free survival, previously reported, and OS. Final OS analysis was triggered by 385 prespecified events. The median OS was 21.6 months (95% CI, 18.89 to 25.07) with margetuximab versus 21.9 months (95% CI, 18.69 to 24.18) with trastuzumab (hazard ratio [HR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.17; P = .620). Preplanned, exploratory analysis of CD16A genotyping suggested a possible improvement in OS for margetuximab in CD16A-158FF patients versus trastuzumab (median OS, 23.6 v 19.2 months; HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.00) and a possible improvement in OS for trastuzumab in CD16A-158VV patients versus margetuximab (median OS, 31.1 v 22.0 months; HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.01 to 3.12). Margetuximab safety was comparable with trastuzumab. Final overall OS analysis did not demonstrate margetuximab advantage over trastuzumab.

Methods: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01462890), patients with newly diagnosed International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB-IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer underwent primary cytoreductive surgery followed by six cycles of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 plus carboplatin area under the curve 5 once every 3 weeks) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg once every 3 weeks). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive bevacizumab for either 15 or 30 months, stratified by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage/residual tumor. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST version 1.1. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), safety, and tolerability.

Results: Between November 11, 2011, and August 6, 2013, 927 women were randomly assigned. There was no difference in PFS between treatment arms (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.15; unstratified log-rank P = .90). Median PFS was 24.2 versus 26.0 months with standard versus extended duration of bevacizumab, respectively; restricted mean PFS was 39.5 versus 39.3 months, respectively. There was no OS difference between treatment arms (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.23; P = .68). Serious/nonserious adverse events of special interest occurred in 29% versus 34% of patients in the standard versus experimental arms, respectively, and were consistent with the known safety profile of standard bevacizumab.

Conclusion: Longer treatment duration with bevacizumab for up to 30 months did not improve PFS or OS in patients with primary epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer.

Methods: Patients (n = 1,013) with EGFR/ALK wild-type mNSCLC were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to tremelimumab 75 mg plus durvalumab 1,500 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy for up to four 21-day cycles, followed by durvalumab once every 4 weeks until progression and one additional tremelimumab dose; durvalumab plus chemotherapy for up to four 21-day cycles, followed by durvalumab once every 4 weeks until progression; or chemotherapy for up to six 21-day cycles (with or without maintenance pemetrexed; all arms). Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for D + CT versus CT. Key alpha-controlled secondary end points were PFS and OS for T + D + CT versus CT.

Results: PFS was significantly improved with D + CT versus CT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.89; P = .0009; median, 5.5 v 4.8 months); a trend for improved OS did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.02; P = .0758; median, 13.3 v 11.7 months; 24-month OS, 29.6% v 22.1%). PFS (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.86; P = .0003; median, 6.2 v 4.8 months) and OS (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.92; P = .0030; median, 14.0 v 11.7 months; 24-month OS, 32.9% v 22.1%) were significantly improved with T + D + CT versus CT. Treatment-related adverse events were maximum grade 3/4 in 51.8%, 44.6%, and 44.4% of patients receiving T + D + CT, D + CT, and CT, respectively; 15.5%, 14.1%, and 9.9%, respectively, discontinued treatment because of treatment-related adverse events.

Conclusion: D + CT significantly improved PFS versus CT. A limited course of tremelimumab added to durvalumab and chemotherapy significantly improved OS and PFS versus CT, without meaningful additional tolerability burden, representing a potential new option in first-line mNSCLC.",2023-2-20,JCO.22.00975,"[{'Author': 'Melissa L.

We investigated the efficacy of smartphone problem-solving therapy and behavioral activation applications in breast cancer survivors.

Methods: This was a decentralized randomized trial. Participants were disease-free breast cancer survivors age 20-49 years who were randomly assigned to the smartphone-based intervention or waitlist control. Both groups received treatment as usual. The control group could access the smartphone apps during weeks 8-24. The intervention comprised smartphone problem-solving therapy and behavioral activation apps. The primary end point was the Concerns About Recurrence Scale at week 8. Secondary outcomes included the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form (FCRI-SF), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Short-form Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34), and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory at weeks 8 and 24 (trial registration: UMIN-CTR: UMIN000031140).

Results: The intervention group included 223 participants, and the control group included 224 participants. Primary outcome data were obtained for 444 participants, and 213 participants in the intervention arm completed the week 24 assessment. The intervention group had statistically greater improvements than controls at week 8 on the Concerns About Recurrence Scale (difference –1.39; 95% CI, –1.93 to –0.85; P < .001), FCRI-SF (difference –1.65; 95% CI, –2.41 to –0.89; P < .001), HADS depression (difference –0.49; 95% CI, –0.98 to 0; P < .05), and SCNS-SF34 psychological domain (difference –1.49; 95% CI, –2.67 to –0.32; P < .05). These scores at week 24 were not statistically significant compared with week 8 although the HADS depression score at week 24 was significantly reduced (P = .03).

Conclusion: Novel smartphone psychotherapy offers a promising way to reduce FCR given the large number of survivors and a limited number of therapists to competently conduct psychotherapy.",2023-2-10,JCO.22.00699,"[{'Author': 'Tatsuo Akechi', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: lectures fees from Chugai, Daiichi-Sankyo, Dainippon-Sumitomo, Eizai, Janssen, Kyowa, Lilly, MSD, Meiji-Seika Pharma, Mochida, Otsuka, Takeda, and Viatris, and royalties from Igaku-Shoin', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: The inventor of the pending patents (2020-135195) (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Takuhiro Yamaguchi', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: STATCOM', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Ono Pharmaceutical, Kowa, Japan Tobacco Inc, Chugai Pharma, DAIICHI SANKYO COMPANY, LIMITED, Eisai, EP Croit Co., Ltd, 3H Clinical Trial, SONIRE Therapeutics Inc, SEIKAGAKU CORPORATION, Otsuka, Incyte', ""Speakers' Bureau: Daiichi Sankyo, Takeda, Mebix, AstraZeneca"", 'Research Funding: AC Medical (Inst), A2 Healthcare (Inst), Facet Biotech (Inst), Japan Tobacco Inc (Inst), Japan Media Corporation (Inst), Medidata Solutions, Inc (Inst), Ono Pharmaceutical (Inst), intellim (Inst), Welby (Inst), 3H Medi Solution (Inst), NIPRO CORPORATION (Inst), Hemp Kitchen (Inst), Nobori Ltd (Inst), Puravida Technologies (Inst), Medrio (Inst), 3H Clinical Trial (Inst), Senju Pharmaceutical (Inst), Otsuka (Inst), Eisai (Inst), ClinChoice (Inst), Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd']}, {'Author': 'Tempei Miyaji', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Pfizer, Takeda, Merck, AYUMI, Welby', 'Research Funding: AC Medical (Inst), A2 Healthcare (Inst), CAC Croit Corporation (Inst), Japan Tobacco Inc (Inst), Japan Media Corporation (Inst), Luminary Medical (Inst), Medidata Solutions, Inc (Inst), Ono Pharmaceutical (Inst), FMD K&L Japan (Inst), intellim (Inst), Welby (Inst), 3H Medi Solution (Inst), Nipro Corporation (Inst), New Age Trading (Inst), NOBORI Ltd (Inst), Puravida Technologies (Inst), Medrio (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Toshi A.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co‐primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

We report 5-year results from the phase III KEYNOTE-042 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02220894). Eligible patients with locally advanced/metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without EGFR/ALK alterations and with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 1% received pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 35 cycles or chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitaxel or pemetrexed) for 4-6 cycles with optional maintenance pemetrexed. Primary end points were overall survival (OS) in PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50%, ≥ 20%, and ≥ 1% groups. Patients who completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab with ≥ stable disease could begin second-course pembrolizumab upon progression. One thousand two hundred seventy‐four patients were randomly assigned (pembrolizumab, n = 637; chemotherapy, n = 637). Median follow-up time was 61.1 (range, 50.0-76.3) months. OS outcomes favored pembrolizumab (v chemotherapy) regardless of PD-L1 TPS (hazard ratio [95% CI] for TPS ≥ 50%, 0.68 [0.57 to 0.81]; TPS ≥ 20%, 0.75 [0.64 to 0.87]; TPS ≥ 1%, 0.79 [0.70 to 0.89]), with estimated 5-year OS rates with pembrolizumab of 21.9%, 19.4%, and 16.6%, respectively. No new toxicities were identified. Objective response rate was 84.3% among 102 patients who completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab and 15.2% among 33 patients who received second-course pembrolizumab.

Telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso-V), a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate targeting c-Met, has shown a tolerable safety profile and antitumor activity as monotherapy. Herein, we report the results of a phase Ib study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02099058) evaluating Teliso-V plus erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in patients with c-Met–positive (+) NSCLC.

Patients and Methods: This study evaluated Teliso-V (2.7 mg/kg once every 21 days) plus erlotinib (150 mg once daily) in adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with c-Met+ NSCLC. Later enrollment required presence of an EGFR-activating mutation (EGFR-M+) and progression on a prior EGFR TKI. End points included safety, pharmacokinetics, objective response rate (ORR), and progression-free survival (PFS). The efficacy-evaluable population consisted of c-Met+ patients (confirmed histology [H]-score ≥ 150) who had at least one postbaseline scan; c-Met+ patients with H-scores ≥ 225 were classified as c-Met high.

Results: As of January 2020, 42 patients were enrolled (N = 36 efficacy-evaluable). Neuropathies were the most common any-grade adverse events reported, with 24 of 42 patients (57%) experiencing at least one event. The pharmacokinetic profile of Teliso-V plus erlotinib was similar to Teliso-V monotherapy. Median PFS for all efficacy-evaluable patients was 5.9 months (95% CI, 2.8 to not reached). ORR for EGFR-M+ patients (n = 28) was 32.1%. Of EGFR-M+ patients, those who were c-Met high (n = 15) had an ORR of 52.6%. Median PFS was 6.8 months for non-T790M+ and for those whose T790M status was unknown, versus 3.7 months for T790M+.

Conclusion: Teliso-V plus erlotinib showed encouraging antitumor activity and acceptable toxicity in EGFR TKI-pretreated patients with EGFR-M+, c-Met+ NSCLC.",2023-2-10,JCO.22.00739,"[{'Author': 'D.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibition has a synthetic lethal relationship with NF2 loss. Given the predominance of NF2 mutations in meningiomas, we evaluated the efficacy of GSK2256098, a FAK inhibitor, as part of the first genomically driven phase II study in recurrent or progressive grade 1-3 meningiomas.

Patients and Methods: Eligible patients whose tumors screened positively for NF2 mutations were treated with GSK2256098, 750 mg orally twice daily, until progressive disease. Efficacy was evaluated using two coprimary end points: progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6) and response rate by Macdonald criteria, where PFS6 was evaluated separately within grade-based subgroups: grade 1 versus 2/3 meningiomas. Per study design, the FAK inhibitor would be considered promising in this patient population if either end point met the corresponding decision criteria for efficacy.

Results: Of 322 patients screened for all mutation cohorts of the study, 36 eligible and evaluable patients with NF2 mutations were enrolled and treated: 12 grade 1 and 24 grade 2/3 patients. Across all grades, one patient had a partial response and 24 had stable disease as their best response to treatment. In grade 1 patients, the observed PFS6 rate was 83% (10/12 patients; 95% CI, 52 to 98). In grade 2/3 patients, the observed PFS6 rate was 33% (8/24 patients; 95% CI, 16 to 55). The study met the PFS6 efficacy end point both for the grade 1 and the grade 2/3 cohorts. Treatment was well tolerated; seven patients had a maximum grade 3 adverse event that was at least possibly related to treatment with no grade 4 or 5 events.

Conclusion: GSK2256098 was well tolerated and resulted in an improved PFS6 rate in patients with recurrent or progressive NF2-mutated meningiomas, compared with historical controls. The criteria for promising activity were met, and FAK inhibition warrants further evaluation for this patient population.",2023-1-20,JCO.21.02371,"[{'Author': 'Priscilla K.

Methods: This pivotal phase II, open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03758417), conducted across eight sites in China, enrolled adult patients with RRMM who had received ≥ 3 lines of prior therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulatory drug. Patients received a single infusion of cilta-cel (target dose 0.75 × 106 chimeric antigen receptor–positive viable T cells/kg). The primary end point was overall response rate. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs).

Results: As of the clinical cutoff of July 19, 2021, 48 patients received a cilta-cel infusion. At an 18-month median follow-up, the overall response rate was 89.6% (95% CI, 77.3 to 96.5), with a median time to first response of approximately 1 month; 77.1% of patients (95% CI, 62.7 to 88.0) achieved complete response or better. Medians for duration of response, PFS, and OS were not reached. The 18-month PFS and OS rates were 66.8% (95% CI, 49.4 to 79.4) and 78.7% (95% CI, 64.0 to 88.0), respectively. Hematologic AEs were common, including anemia (100%), neutropenia (97.9%), lymphopenia (95.8%), and thrombocytopenia (87.5%). Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 97.9% of patients (35.4% grade 3/4); the median time to onset was 7 days, and the median duration was 5 days. Infections occurred in 85.4% of patients (37.5% grade 3/4). Ten deaths occurred after cilta-cel infusion, eight of which were due to treatment-related AEs.

Conclusion: These data demonstrate a favorable risk-benefit profile for a single infusion of cilta-cel, resulting in early, deep, and durable responses in heavily pretreated patients with RRMM in China.",2023-2-20,JCO.22.00690,"[{'Author': 'Yiwen Zhang', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: Legend Biotech', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Legend Biotech', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Legend Biotech']}, {'Author': 'Diana Chen', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: Janssen']}, {'Author': 'Jordan M.

In our previous study, metronomic chemotherapy improved survival in this setting. Retrospective data suggest that a low dose of nivolumab may be efficacious. Hence, we aimed to assess whether the addition of low-dose nivolumab to triple metronomic chemotherapy (TMC) improved overall survival (OS).

Methods: This was a randomized phase III superiority study. Adult patients with recurrent or newly diagnosed advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma being treated with palliative intent with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to TMC consisting of oral methotrexate 9 mg/m2 once a week, celecoxib 200 mg twice daily, and erlotinib 150 mg once daily, or TMC with intravenous nivolumab (TMC-I) 20 mg flat dose once every 3 weeks. The primary end point was 1-year OS.

Results: One hundred fifty-one patients were randomly assigned, 75 in TMC and 76 in the TMC-I arm. The addition of low-dose nivolumab led to an improvement in the 1-year OS from 16.3% (95% CI, 8.0 to 27.4) to 43.4% (95% CI, 30.8 to 55.3; hazard ratio, 0.545; 95% CI, 0.362 to 0.820; P = .0036). The median OS in TMC and TMC-I arms was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.8 to 8.1) and 10.1 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 12.6), respectively (P = .0052). The rate of grade 3 and above adverse events was 50% and 46.1% in TMC and TMC-I arms, respectively (P = .744).

Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first-ever randomized study to demonstrate that the addition of low-dose nivolumab to metronomic chemotherapy improved OS and is an alternative standard of care for those who cannot access full-dose checkpoint inhibitors.",2023-1-10,JCO.22.01015,"[{'Author': 'Vijay Maruti Patil', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, AstraZeneca, Intas, NATCO Pharma, Eisai Germany, Novartis']}, {'Author': 'Vanita Noronha', 'Disclosures': [""Research Funding: Sanofi/Aventis, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Intas, AstraZeneca"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: American Society of Clinical Oncology']}, {'Author': 'Kumar Prabhash', 'Disclosures': [""Research Funding: Biocon, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Fresenius Kabi, AIkem Laboratories, NATCO Pharma, BDR Pharmaceutics, Roche"", 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

The primary objective was OS, and secondary objectives included PFS, response rate, and treatment adverse events (AEs) including delayed CNS toxicities.

Methods: NRG Oncology/RTOG1205 is a prospective, phase II, randomized trial of re-RT and BEV versus BEV alone. Stratification factors included age, resection, and Karnofsky performance status (KPS). Patients with recurrent GBM with imaging evidence of tumor progression ≥ 6 months from completion of prior chemo-RT were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to re-RT, 35 Gy in 10 fractions, with concurrent BEV IV 10 mg/kg once in every 2 weeks or BEV alone until progression.

Results: From December 2012 to April 2016, 182 patients were randomly assigned, of whom 170 were eligible. Patient characteristics were well balanced between arms. The median follow-up for censored patients was 12.8 months. There was no improvement in OS for BEV + RT, hazard ratio, 0.98; 80% CI, 0.79 to 1.23; P = .46; the median survival time was 10.1 versus 9.7 months for BEV + RT versus BEV alone. The median PFS for BEV + RT was 7.1 versus 3.8 months for BEV, hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.0; P = .05. The 6-month PFS rate improved from 29.1% (95% CI, 19.1 to 39.1) for BEV to 54.3% (95% CI, 43.5 to 65.1) for BEV + RT, P = .001. Treatment was well tolerated. There were a 5% rate of acute grade 3+ treatment-related AEs and no delayed high-grade AEs. Most patients died of recurrent GBM.

Conclusion: To our knowledge, NRG Oncology/RTOG1205 is the first prospective, randomized multi-institutional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of re-RT in recurrent GBM using modern RT techniques. Overall, re-RT was shown to be safe and well tolerated.

Benson III,CT; MA; MA; IL; CA; CA; CA; KY; TX; MA; CA; MN; OH; MI; CA; NY; FL; PA; IL,"Purpose: Patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have few treatment options that yield objective responses. Retrospective and small prospective studies suggest that capecitabine and temozolomide are associated with high response rates (RRs) and long progression-free survival (PFS).

Patients and Methods: E2211 was a multicenter, randomized, phase II trial comparing temozolomide versus capecitabine/temozolomide in patients with advanced low-grade or intermediate-grade pancreatic NETs. Key eligibility criteria included progression within the preceding 12 months and no prior temozolomide, dimethyl-triazeno-imidazole-carboxamide or dacarbazine, capecitabine or fluorouracil. The primary end point was PFS; secondary endpoints were overall survival, RR, safety, and methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) by immunohistochemistry and promoter methylation.

Results: A total of 144 patients were enrolled between April 2013 and March 2016 to temozolomide (n = 72) or capecitabine and temozolomide (n = 72); the primary analysis population included 133 eligible patients. At the scheduled interim analysis in January 2018, the median PFS was 14.4 months for temozolomide versus 22.7 months for capecitabine/temozolomide (hazard ratio = 0.58), which was sufficient to reject the null hypothesis for the primary end point (stratified log-rank P = .022). In the final analysis (May 2021), the median overall survival was 53.8 months for temozolomide and 58.7 months for capecitabine/temozolomide (hazard ratio = 0.82, P = .42). MGMT deficiency was associated with response.

Conclusion: The combination of capecitabine/temozolomide was associated with a significant improvement in PFS compared with temozolomide alone in patients with advanced pancreatic NETs. The median PFS and RR observed with capecitabine/temozolomide are the highest reported in a randomized study for pancreatic NETs. MGMT deficiency was associated with response, and although routine MGMT testing is not recommended, it can be considered for select patients in need of objective response (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01824875).",2023-3-1,JCO.22.01013,"[{'Author': 'Pamela L.

We investigated whether cediranib combined with olaparib improves the clinical outcomes of patients with prostate cancer.

Methods: Patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were randomly assigned 1:1 to arm A: cediranib 30 mg once daily plus olaparib 200 mg twice daily or arm B: olaparib 300 mg twice daily alone. The primary end point was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in the intention-to-treat patients. The secondary end points were rPFS in patients with HRR-deficient and HRR-proficient mCRPC.

Results: In the intention-to-treat set of 90 patients, median rPFS was 8.5 (95% CI, 5.4 to 12.0) and 4.0 (95% CI, 3.2 to 8.5) months in arms A and B, respectively. Cediranib/olaparib significantly improved rPFS versus olaparib alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.617; 95% CI, 0.392 to 0.969; P = .0359). Descriptive analyses showed a median rPFS of 10.6 (95% CI, 5.9 to not assessed [NA]) and 3.8 (95% CI, 2.33 to NA) months (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.272 to 1.504) among patients with HRR-deficient mCRPC, and 13.8 (95% CI, 3.3 to NA) and 11.3 (95% CI, 3.8 to NA) months (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.321 to 2.988) among patients with BRCA2-mutated mCRPC in arms A and B, respectively. The incidence of grades 3-4 adverse events was 61% and 18% in arms A and B, respectively.

Conclusion: Cediranib combined with olaparib improved rPFS compared with olaparib alone in men with mCRPC. This combination was associated with an increased incidence of grades 3-4 adverse events. BRCA2-mutated subgroups treated with olaparib with or without cediranib were associated with a numerically longer median rPFS.",2023-2-1,JCO.21.02947,"[{'Author': 'Joseph W.

Identification of Patients With Ovarian Cancer Experiencing the Highest Benefit From Bevacizumab in the First-Line Setting on the Basis of Their Tumor-Intrinsic Chemosensitivity (KELIM): The GOG-0218 Validation Study,Benoit  You; Christopher  Purdy; Larry J.

Burger,France; France; NY; OH; WA; CA; IL; TX; VA; CA; AZ; OK; OK; CA; OH; NC; MO; MN; PA; MA; France; France; PA; MA,"Purpose: In patients with high-grade ovarian cancer, predictors of bevacizumab efficacy in first-line setting are needed. In the ICON-7 trial, a poor tumor intrinsic chemosensitivity (defined by unfavorable modeled cancer antigen-125 [CA-125] ELIMination rate constant K [KELIM] score) was a predictive biomarker. Only the patients with high-risk disease (suboptimally resected stage III, or stage IV) exhibiting unfavorable KELIM score < 1.0 had overall survival (OS) benefit from bevacizumab (median: 29.7 v 20.6 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.78). An external validation study in the GOG-0218 trial was performed.

Methods: In GOG-0218, 1,873 patients were treated with carboplatin-paclitaxel ± concurrent-maintenance bevacizumab/placebo. Patient KELIM values were calculated with CA-125 kinetics during the first 100 chemotherapy days by the Lyon University team. The association between KELIM score (favorable ≥ 1.0, or unfavorable < 1.0) and bevacizumab benefit for progression-free survival (PFS)/OS was independently assessed by NGR-GOG using univariate/multivariate analyses.

Results: KELIM was assessable in 1,662 patients with ≥ 3 CA-125 available values. An unfavorable KELIM score was associated with bevacizumab benefit compared with placebo (PFS: HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.82; OS: HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.03), whereas a favorable KELIM was not (PFS: HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.17; OS: HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.39). The highest benefit was observed in patients with a high-risk disease exhibiting unfavorable KELIM, for PFS (median: 9.1 v 5.6 months; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.78), and for OS (median: 35.1 v 29.1 months; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97).

Conclusion: This GOG-0218 trial investigation validates ICON-7 findings about the association between poor tumor chemosensitivity and benefit from concurrent-maintenance bevacizumab, suggesting that bevacizumab may mainly be effective in patients with poorly chemosensitive disease. Bevacizumab may be prioritized in patients with a high-risk and poorly chemosensitive disease to improve their PFS/OS (patient KELIM score calculator available on the Biomarker Kinetics website).",2022-12-1,JCO.22.01207,"[{'Author': 'Benoit You', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: `Roche/Genentech, AstraZeneca, Novartis, LEK, TESARO, Bayer, Amgen, Clovis Oncology, GlaxoSmithKline, ECS PROGASTRIN, Immunomedics, Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH, Myriad Genetics, MSD Oncology, Seattle Genetics', 'Research Funding: Merck Serono (Inst), Roche/Genentech (Inst), Clovis Oncology (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche/Genentech, AstraZeneca, BMS, MSD Oncology, Bayer']}, {'Author': 'Larry J.

Quinn,NY; CT; MA; MA; Japan; Italy; Australia; Republic of Korea; the Netherlands; Israel; France; Taiwan; Taiwan; Spain; France; Hungary; NJ; Germany; NJ; NJ; Belgium; NJ; NJ; CA,"Purpose: Rogaratinib, an oral pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1-4) inhibitor, showed promising phase I efficacy and safety in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) with FGFR1-3 mRNA overexpression. We assessed rogaratinib efficacy and safety versus chemotherapy in patients with FGFR mRNA-positive advanced/metastatic UC previously treated with platinum chemotherapy.

Methods: FORT-1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03410693) was a phase II/III, randomized, open-label trial. Patients with FGFR1/3 mRNA-positive locally advanced or metastatic UC with ≥ 1 prior platinum-containing regimen were randomly assigned (1:1) to rogaratinib (800 mg orally twice daily, 3-week cycles; n = 87) or chemotherapy (docetaxel 75 mg/m2, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, or vinflunine 320 mg/m2 intravenously once every 3 weeks; n = 88). The primary end point was overall survival, with objective response rate (ORR) analysis planned following phase II accrual. Because of comparable efficacy between treatments, enrollment was stopped before progression to phase III; a full interim analysis of phase II was completed.

Results: ORRs were 20.7% (rogaratinib, 18/87; 95% CI, 12.7 to 30.7) and 19.3% (chemotherapy, 17/88; 95% CI, 11.7 to 29.1). Median overall survival was 8.3 months (95% CI, 6.5 to not estimable) and 9.8 months (95% CI, 6.8 to not estimable; hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.72; P = .67). Grade 3/4 events occurred in 37 (43.0%)/4 (4.7%) patients and 32 (39.0%)/15 (18.3%), respectively. No rogaratinib-related deaths occurred. Exploratory analysis of patients with FGFR3 DNA alterations showed ORRs of 52.4% (11/21; 95% CI, 29.8 to 74.3) for rogaratinib and 26.7% (4/15; 95% CI, 7.8 to 55.1) for chemotherapy.

Conclusion: To our knowledge, these are the first data to compare FGFR-directed therapy with chemotherapy in patients with FGFR-altered UC, showing comparable efficacy and manageable safety.

Ramsey,NY; WA; WA; WA; WA; WA; WA; WA; WA; WA; IL; MI; NM; IA; PA; ID; WA,"Purpose: Primary prophylactic colony-stimulating factors (PP-CSFs) are prescribed to reduce febrile neutropenia (FN) but their benefit for intermediate FN risk regimens is uncertain. Within a pragmatic, randomized trial of a standing order entry (SOE) PP-CSF intervention, we conducted a substudy to evaluate the effectiveness of SOE for patients receiving intermediate-risk regimens.

Methods: TrACER was a cluster randomized trial where practices were randomized to usual care or a guideline-based SOE intervention. In the primary study, sites were randomized 3:1 to SOE of automated PP-CSF orders for high FN risk regimens and alerts against PP-CSF use for low-risk regimens versus usual care. A secondary 1:1 randomization assigned 24 intervention sites to either SOE to prescribe or an alert to not prescribe PP-CSF for intermediate-risk regimens. Clinicians were allowed to over-ride the SOE. Patients with breast, colorectal, or non–small-cell lung cancer were enrolled. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were used to test differences between randomized sites.

Results: Between January 2016 and April 2020, 846 eligible patients receiving intermediate-risk regimens were registered to either SOE to prescribe (12 sites: n = 542) or an alert to not prescribe PP-CSF (12 sites: n = 304). Rates of PP-CSF use were higher among sites randomized to SOE (37.1% v 9.9%, odds ratio, 5.91; 95% CI, 1.77 to 19.70; P = .0038). Rates of FN were low and identical between arms (3.7% v 3.7%).

Conclusion: Although implementation of a SOE intervention for PP-CSF significantly increased PP-CSF use among patients receiving first-line intermediate-risk regimens, FN rates were low and did not differ between arms. Although this guideline-informed SOE influenced prescribing, the results suggest that neither SOE nor PP-CSF provides sufficient benefit to justify their use for all patients receiving first-line intermediate-risk regimens.",2023-1-20,JCO.22.01258,"[{'Author': 'Dawn L.

Ramalingam,MD; Republic of Korea; Romania; Spain; Japan; Hungary; France; Argentina; Canada; Poland; the Netherlands; Chile; United Kingdom; NY; Spain; Germany; PA; Australia; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; GA,"Purpose: We present 5-year results from CheckMate 227 Part 1, in which nivolumab plus ipilimumab improved overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer, regardless of tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status.

Methods: Adults with stage IV/recurrent non–small-cell lung cancer without EGFR mutations or ALK alterations and with tumor PD-L1 ≥ 1% or < 1% (n = 1739) were randomly assigned. Patients with tumor PD-L1 ≥ 1% were randomly assigned to first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab alone, or chemotherapy. Patients with tumor PD-L1 < 1% were randomly assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy. End points included exploratory 5-year results for efficacy, safety, and quality of life.

Results: At a minimum follow-up of 61.3 months, 5-year OS rates were 24% versus 14% for nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy (PD-L1 ≥ 1%) and 19% versus 7% (PD-L1 < 1%). The median duration of response was 24.5 versus 6.7 months (PD-L1 ≥ 1%) and 19.4 versus 4.8 months (PD-L1 < 1%). Among patients surviving 5 years, 66% (PD-L1 ≥ 1%) and 64% (PD-L1 < 1%) were off nivolumab plus ipilimumab without initiating subsequent systemic anticancer treatment by the 5-year time point. Survival benefit continued after nivolumab plus ipilimumab discontinuation because of treatment-related adverse events, with a 5-year OS rate of 39% (combined PD-L1 ≥ 1% and < 1% populations). Quality of life in 5-year survivors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab was similar to that in the general US population through the 5-year follow-up. No new safety signals were observed.

Conclusion: With all patients off immunotherapy treatment for ≥ 3 years, nivolumab plus ipilimumab increased 5-year survivorship versus chemotherapy, including long-term, durable clinical benefit regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. These data support nivolumab plus ipilimumab as an effective first-line treatment for patients with metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer.",2023-2-20,JCO.22.01503,"[{'Author': 'Julie R.

"DaBlaCa-13 Study: Oncological Outcome of Short-Term, Intensive Chemoresection With Mitomycin in Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer: Primary Outcome of a Randomized Controlled Trial",Maria S.  Lindgren; Erik  Hansen; Nessn  Azawi; Anna M.  Nielsen; Lars  Dyrskjøt; Jørgen B.  Jensen,Denmark; Denmark; Denmark; Denmark; Denmark; Denmark; Denmark; Denmark; Denmark; Denmark; Denmark; Denmark,"Purpose: This study aimed to assess long-term follow-up after chemoresection with mitomycin (MMC), a nonsurgical treatment modality for recurrent nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). At the time of recurrence, chemoresection has previously been shown to reduce the number of patients requiring a procedure (transurethral resection of bladder tumors [TURBT] or office biopsy) by more than 50%. This study investigated the number of patients requiring a procedure during initial treatment and 2-year follow-up in patients treated with short-term, intensive chemoresection with MMC compared with patients undergoing standard surgical treatment of recurrent NMIBC.

Methods: A randomized, controlled trial was conducted in two urological departments in Denmark from January 2018 to August 2021. In total, 120 patients with a history of Ta low- or high-grade NMIBC were included upon recurrence. The intervention group received intravesical MMC (40 mg/40 mL) three times a week for 2 weeks and TURBT or office biopsy only if the response was incomplete. The control group received TURBT or office biopsy and 6 weekly adjuvant instillations. The primary outcome was the number of patients undergoing a procedure within 2 years from inclusion, which was compared between groups using the chi-squared test. Recurrence-free survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results: Significantly fewer patients were in need of a procedure in the intervention group than in the control group: 71% (95% CI, 57 to 81) and 100% (95% CI, 94 to 100), P < .001. The 12-month recurrence-free survival was 36% (95% CI, 24 to 50) and 43% (95% CI, 30 to 56) in the intervention and control groups, respectively (P = .5).

Conclusion: Short-term intensive chemoresection is an effective treatment strategy for recurrent NMIBC that leads to a reduced number of required procedures without compromising long-term oncological safety.",2023-1-10,JCO.22.00470,"[{'Author': 'Maria S.

Post hoc analysis of long-term efficacy and progression-free survival on next-line therapy (PFS2) is presented.

Methods: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to pembrolizumab, pembrolizumab-chemotherapy, or cetuximab-chemotherapy. Efficacy was evaluated in programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 20, CPS ≥ 1, and total populations, with no multiplicity or alpha adjustment.

Results: The median study follow-up was 45.0 months (interquartile range, 41.0-49.2; n = 882). At data cutoff (February 18, 2020), overall survival improved with pembrolizumab in the PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.81) and CPS ≥ 1 populations (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.89) and was noninferior in the total population (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.97). Overall survival improved with pembrolizumab-chemotherapy in the PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.84), CPS ≥ 1 (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.78), and total (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.85) populations. The objective response rate on second-course pembrolizumab was 27.3% (3 of 11). PFS2 improved with pembrolizumab in the PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.84) and CPS ≥ 1 (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.95) populations and with pembrolizumab-chemotherapy in the PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.86), CPS ≥ 1 (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.81), and total (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.88) populations. PFS2 was similar after pembrolizumab and longer after pembrolizumab-chemotherapy on next-line taxanes and shorter after pembrolizumab and similar after pembrolizumab-chemotherapy on next-line nontaxanes.

Conclusion: With a 4-year follow-up, first-line pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab-chemotherapy continued to demonstrate survival benefit versus cetuximab-chemotherapy in recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

Patients and Methods: Patients (N = 465) with treatment-naive, advanced NSCLC without EGFR/ALK mutations were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive toripalimab 240 mg (n = 309) or placebo (n = 156) once every 3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy for 4-6 cycles, followed by the maintenance of toripalimab or placebo once every 3 weeks plus standard care. Stratification factors included programmed death ligand-1 expression status, histology, and smoking status. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator per RECIST v1.1. Secondary end points included overall survival and safety.

Results: At the final PFS analysis, PFS was significantly longer in the toripalimab arm than in the placebo arm (median PFS, 8.4 v 5.6 months, hazard ratio = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.61; two-sided P < .0001). At the interim OS analysis, the toripalimab arm had a significantly longer OS than the placebo arm (median OS not reached v 17.1 months, hazard ratio = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.92; two-sided P = .0099). The incidence of grade ≥ 3 adverse events was similar between the two arms. Treatment effects were similar regardless of programmed death ligand-1 status. Genomic analysis using whole-exome sequencing from 394 available tumor samples revealed that patients with high tumor mutational burden were associated with significantly better PFS in the toripalimab arm (median PFS 13.1 v 5.5 months, interaction P = .026). Notably, patients with mutations in the focal adhesion-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway achieved significantly better PFS and OS in the toripalimab arm (interaction P values ≤ .001).

Conclusion: Toripalimab plus chemotherapy significantly improves PFS and OS in patients with treatment-naive advanced NSCLC while having a manageable safety profile.

Matulonis,MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA,"Purpose: Estrogen receptor (ER)–positive endometrial cancers (ECs) are characterized by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS/β-catenin (CTNNB1) pathway alterations in approximately 90% and 80% of cases, respectively. Extensive cross-talk between ER, PI3K, and RTK/RAS/CTNNB1 pathways leads to both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent ER transcriptional activity as well as upregulation of cyclin D1 which, in complex with cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6), is a critical regulator of cell cycle progression and a key mediator of resistance to hormonal therapy. We hypothesized that the combination of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole and CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib would demonstrate promising activity in this setting.

Methods: We conducted a phase II, two-stage study of letrozole/abemaciclib in recurrent ER-positive EC. Eligibility criteria included measurable disease, no limit on prior therapies, and all EC histologies; prior hormonal therapy was allowed. Primary end points were objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 and progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months.

Results: At the data cutoff date (December 03, 2021), 30 patients (28 with endometrioid EC) initiated protocol therapy; 15 (50%) patients had prior hormonal therapy. There were nine total responses (eight confirmed), for an objective response rate of 30% (95% CI, 14.7 to 49.4), all in endometrioid adenocarcinomas. Median PFS was 9.1 months, PFS at 6 months was 55.6% (95% CI, 35.1 to 72), and median duration of response was 7.4 months. Most common ≥ grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (20%) and anemia (17%). Responses were observed regardless of grade, prior hormonal therapy, mismatch repair, and progesterone receptor status. Exploratory tumor profiling revealed several mechanistically relevant candidate predictors of response (CTNNB1, KRAS, and CDKN2A mutations) or absence of response (TP53 mutations), which require independent validation.

Conclusion: Letrozole/abemaciclib demonstrated encouraging and durable evidence of activity in recurrent ER positive endometrioid EC.",2023-1-20,JCO.22.00628,"[{'Author': 'Panagiotis A.

Little prospective data exist to guide the choice of either initial therapy or treatment sequence in this population. This study was conducted to determine which initial treatment or treatment sequence produced the best efficacy.

Patients AND Methods: In a phase III trial, patients with treatment-naive BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma were randomly assigned to receive either combination nivolumab/ipilimumab (arm A) or dabrafenib/trametinib (arm B) in step 1, and at disease progression were enrolled in step 2 to receive the alternate therapy, dabrafenib/trametinib (arm C) or nivolumab/ipilimumab (arm D). The primary end point was 2-year overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were 3-year OS, objective response rate, response duration, progression-free survival, crossover feasibility, and safety.

Results: A total of 265 patients were enrolled, with 73 going onto step 2 (27 in arm C and 46 in arm D). The study was stopped early by the independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee because of a clinically significant end point being achieved. The 2-year OS for those starting on arm A was 71.8% (95% CI, 62.5 to 79.1) and arm B 51.5% (95% CI, 41.7 to 60.4; log-rank P = .010). Step 1 progression-free survival favored arm A (P = .054). Objective response rates were arm A: 46.0%; arm B: 43.0%; arm C: 47.8%; and arm D: 29.6%. Median duration of response was not reached for arm A and 12.7 months for arm B (P < .001). Crossover occurred in 52% of patients with documented disease progression. Grade ≥ 3 toxicities occurred with similar frequency between arms, and regimen toxicity profiles were as anticipated.

Conclusion: Combination nivolumab/ipilimumab followed by BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy, if necessary, should be the preferred treatment sequence for a large majority of patients.",2023-1-10,JCO.22.01763,[]

The phase III CheckMate 915 trial evaluated adjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone in patients with resected stage IIIB-D or IV melanoma.

Patients and Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, phase III trial, 1,833 patients received nivolumab 240 mg once every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg once every 6 weeks (916 patients) or nivolumab 480 mg once every 4 weeks (917 patients) for ≤ 1 year. After random assignment, patients were stratified by tumor programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and stage. Dual primary end points were recurrence-free survival (RFS) in randomly assigned patients and in the tumor PD-L1 expression-level < 1% subgroup.

Results: At a minimum follow-up of approximately 23.7 months, there was no significant difference between treatment groups for RFS in the all-randomly assigned patient population (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.09; P = .269) or in patients with PD-L1 expression < 1% (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.14). In all patients, 24-month RFS rates were 64.6% (combination) and 63.2% (nivolumab). Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 32.6% of patients in the combination group and 12.8% in the nivolumab group. Treatment-related deaths were reported in 0.4% of patients in the combination group and in no nivolumab-treated patients.

Barker; Tarun  Puri; Aimee  Bence Lin; Herbert  Loong; Benjamin  Besse,NY; TX; Switzerland; France; Italy; Australia; Singapore; Spain; Germany; South Korea; Japan; IN; Poland; IN; IN; IN; China; France,"Purpose: Selpercatinib, a first-in-class, highly selective, and potent CNS-active RET kinase inhibitor, is currently approved for the treatment of patients with RET fusion–positive non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We provide a registrational data set update in more than double (n = 316) of the original reported population (n = 144) and better characterization of long-term efficacy and safety.

Methods: Patients were enrolled to LIBRETTO-001, a phase I/II, single-arm, open-label study of selpercatinib in patients with RET-altered cancers. An analysis of patients with RET fusion–positive NSCLC, including 69 treatment-naive and 247 with prior platinum-based chemotherapy, was performed. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR; RECIST v1.1, independent review committee). Secondary end points included duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and safety.

Results: In treatment-naive patients, the ORR was 84% (95% CI, 73 to 92); 6% achieved complete responses (CRs). The median DoR was 20.2 months (95% CI, 13.0 to could not be evaluated); 40% of responses were ongoing at the data cutoff (median follow-up of 20.3 months). The median PFS was 22.0 months; 35% of patients were alive and progression-free at the data cutoff (median follow-up of 21.9 months). In platinum-based chemotherapy pretreated patients, the ORR was 61% (95% CI, 55 to 67); 7% achieved CRs. The median DoR was 28.6 months (95% CI, 20.4 to could not be evaluated); 49% of responses were ongoing (median follow-up of 21.2 months). The median PFS was 24.9 months; 38% of patients were alive and progression-free (median follow-up of 24.7 months). Of 26 patients with measurable baseline CNS metastasis by the independent review committee, the intracranial ORR was 85% (95% CI, 65 to 96); 27% were CRs. In the full safety population (n = 796), the median treatment duration was 36.1 months. The safety profile of selpercatinib was consistent with previous reports.

Conclusion: In a large cohort with extended follow-up, selpercatinib continued to demonstrate durable and robust responses, including intracranial activity, in previously treated and treatment-naive patients with RET fusion–positive NSCLC.",2023-1-10,JCO.22.00393,"[{'Author': 'Alexander Drilon', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Treeline Bio', 'Honoraria: Medscape, OncLive, PeerVoice, Physicians Education Resources, Targeted Oncology, Research to Practice, Axis, Peerview Institute, Paradigm Medical Communications, WebMD, MJH Life Sciences, Med Learning, Imedex, Answers in CME, Clinical Care Options, EPG Health, JNCC/Harborside, Liberum, Remedica Ltd', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Ignyta/Genentech/Roche, Loxo/Bayer/Lilly, Takeda/Ariad/Millenium, TP Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Blueprint Medicines, Helsinn, Beigene, BergenBio, Hengrui Therapeutics, Exelixis, Tyra Biosciences, Verastem, MORE Health, Abbvie, 14ner/Elevation Oncology, ArcherDX, Monopteros, Novartis, EMD Serono, Medendi, Repare RX, Nuvalent, Merus, Chugai Pharmaceutical, Remedica Ltd, mBrace, AXIS, EPG Health, Harborside Nexus, Liberum, RV More, Ology, Amgen, TouchIME, Janssen, Entos, Treeline Bio, Prelude, Applied Pharmaceutical Science, Inc, AiCME, i3 Health, MonteRosa', 'Research Funding: Pfizer (Inst), Exelixis (Inst), GlaxoSmithKlein (Inst), Teva (Inst), Taiho (Inst), PharmaMar (Inst)', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Selpercatinib-Osimertinib (filed/pending), Wolters Kluwer, Merck, Puma, Merus, Boehringer Ingelheim']}, {'Author': 'Vivek Subbiah', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: MedImmune, Helsinn Therapeutics, Loxo, R-Pharm, QED Therapeutics', 'Research Funding: Novartis (Inst), GlaxoSmithKline (Inst), NanoCarrier (Inst), Northwest Biotherapeutics (Inst), Genentech/Roche (Inst), Berg Pharma (Inst), Bayer (Inst), Incyte (Inst), Fujifilm (Inst), PharmaMar (Inst), D3 Oncology Solutions (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), AbbVie (Inst), MultiVir (Inst), Blueprint Medicines (Inst), Loxo (Inst), Vegenics (Inst), Takeda (Inst), Alfasigma (Inst), Agensys (Inst), Idera (Inst), Boston Biomedical (Inst), Inhibrx (Inst), Exelixis (Inst), Amgen (Inst), Turning Point Therapeutics (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: PharmaMar, Bayer, Novartis, Helsinn Therapeutics', 'Other Relationship: Medscape']}, {'Author': 'Oliver Gautschi', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Amgen (Inst), Lilly (Inst)', 'Other Relationship: Bayer, Pfizer, Roche, Merck, Lilly']}, {'Author': 'Pascale Tomasini', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation, Takeda, Amgen, Janssen', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Takeda']}, {'Author': 'Filippo de Braud', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche, Pfizer, BMS, Merck, MSD, Servier, Sanofi, Amgen Astellas BioPharma, Incyte', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Incyte, EMD Serono, Bristol Myers Squibb, Nerviano Medical Sciences, Sanofi, Novartis Italy, NMS Medical Science, Menarini, AstraZeneca, Pierre Fabre', 'Research Funding: Novartis (Inst), Roche (Inst), Merck Serono (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Servier, Philogen (Inst), Loxo (Inst), Tesaro (Inst), Nerviano Medical Sciences (Inst), Kymab (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb/Medarex, Merck KGaA, Ignyta, MedImmune, Exelixis, Bayer Health, Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH, Incyte, Basilea Pharmaceutical, Janssen Oncology']}, {'Author': 'Benjamin J.

We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of busulfan plus cyclophosphamide (BuCy) and TBI plus cyclophosphamide (TBI-Cy) conditioning in allo-HSCT for adult standard-risk B-cell-ALL in first complete remission (CR1).

Patients and Methods: We performed an open-label, randomized phase III trial at 13 hospitals in China. Eligible patients (age 14-65 years) had standard-risk ALL in CR1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to BuCy (0.8 mg/kg four times per day on days –7 to –4 and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg once daily on days –3 to –2) or TBI-Cy (4.5 Gy TBI on days –5 to –4 and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg once daily on days –3 to –2). The primary end point was 2-year overall survival. Analysis was per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02670252) and is complete.

Results: Between January 2016 and February 2020, 275 patients were assigned to receive BuCy (273 assessed) and 275 to TBI-Cy (272 assessed). The 2-year overall survival was 76.6% (95% CI, 71.7 to 81.8) and 79.4% (74.7 to 84.4; P = .457; difference 2.9%; 95% CI, –4.1 to 9.8; P = .022), indicating noninferiority of BuCy. The 2-year relapse was 20.2% (95% CI, 15.6 to 25.1) and 18.4% (14.0 to 23.2; P = .616), and the nonrelapse mortality was 11.0% (95% CI, 7.6 to 15.0) and 11.0% (7.7 to 15.1; P = .988) in the BuCy and TBI-Cy groups, respectively. There were no differences in regimen-related toxicity, graft-versus-host disease, or late effects between the two groups.

Conclusion: The BuCy regimen has noninferior efficiency and safety as TBI-Cy (4.5 Gy × 2) for patients with adult standard-risk B cell-ALL in CR1 undergoing HLA-matched allo-HSCT.",2023-1-10,JCO.22.00767,[]

We report overall survival (OS) after a 7-year follow-up, a clinically relevant time point and the longest follow-up for any poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor in the first-line setting.

Methods: This double-blind phase III trial randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation in clinical response to platinum-based chemotherapy to maintenance olaparib (n = 260) or placebo (n = 131) for up to 2 years. A prespecified descriptive analysis of OS, a secondary end point, was conducted after a 7-year follow-up.

Results: The median duration of treatment was 24.6 months with olaparib and 13.9 months with placebo, and the median follow-up was 88.9 and 87.4 months, respectively. The hazard ratio for OS was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.76; P = .0004 [P < .0001 required to declare statistical significance]). At 7 years, 67.0% of olaparib patients versus 46.5% of placebo patients were alive, and 45.3% versus 20.6%, respectively, were alive and had not received a first subsequent treatment (Kaplan-Meier estimates). The incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia remained low, and new primary malignancies remained balanced between treatment groups.

Conclusion: Results indicate a clinically meaningful, albeit not statistically significant according to prespecified criteria, improvement in OS with maintenance olaparib in patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCA mutation and support the use of maintenance olaparib to achieve long-term remission in this setting; the potential for cure may also be enhanced.

Wenham,PA; VA; AZ; AZ; MI; MI; CA; the Netherlands; FL; PA; MO; CA; FL; FL,"Purpose: The adjunctive use of intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI) is gaining acceptance as a potential means to improve outcomes for surgical resection of targetable tumors. This confirmatory study examined the use of pafolacianine for real-time detection of folate receptor–positive ovarian cancer.

Methods: This phase III, open-label, 11-center study included subjects with known or suspected ovarian cancer, scheduled to undergo cytoreductive surgery. The objectives were to confirm safety and efficacy of pafolacianine (0.025 mg/kg IV), given ≥ 1 hour before intraoperative near-infrared imaging to detect macroscopic lesions not detected by palpation and normal white light.

Results: From March 2018 through April 2020, 150 patients received a single infusion of pafolacianine (safety analysis set); 109 patients with folate receptor–positive ovarian cancer comprised the full analysis set for efficacy. In 33.0% of patients (95% CI, 24.3 to 42.7; P < .001), pafolacianine with near-infrared imaging identified additional cancer on tissue not planned for resection and not detected by white light assessment and palpation, exceeding the prespecified threshold of 10%. Among patients who underwent interval debulking surgery, the rate was 39.7% (95% CI, 27.0 to 53.4; P < .001). The sensitivity to detect ovarian cancer was 83%, and the patient false-positive rate was 24.8%. Investigators reported achieving complete R0 resection in 62.4% (68 of 109) of patients. Drug-related adverse events were reported by 30% of patients (45 of 150) and most commonly included nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. No drug-related serious adverse events or deaths were reported.

Conclusion: This phase III study of pafolacianine met its primary efficacy end point, identifying additional cancers not otherwise identified or planned for resection. Pafolacianine may offer an important real-time adjunct to current surgical approaches for ovarian cancer.",2023-1-10,JCO.22.00291,[]

This phase Ib/IIa trial was designed to test the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a three-dose schedule in patients with metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Patients and Methods: Patients with refractory NSCLC were assigned to receive three vaccination doses of UCPVax (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 1 mg) using a Bayesian-based phase Ib followed by phase IIa de-escalating design. The primary end points were dose-limiting toxicity and immune response after three first doses of vaccine. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival at 1 year.

Results: A total of 59 patients received UCPVax; 95% had three prior lines of systemic therapy. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 15 patients treated in phase Ib. The maximum tolerated dose was 1 mg. Fifty-one patients were eligible for phase IIa. The third and sixth dose of UCPVax induced specific CD4+ T helper 1 response in 56% and 87.2% of patients, respectively, with no difference between three dose levels. Twenty-one (39%) patients achieved disease control (stable disease, n = 20; complete response, n = 1). The 1-year OS was 34.1% (95% CI, 23.1 to 50.4), and the median OS was 9.7 months, with no significant difference between dose levels. The 1-year progression-free survival and the median OS were 17.2% (95% CI, 7.8 to 38.3) and 11.6 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 16.7) in immune responders (P = .015) and 4.5% (95% CI, 0.7 to 30.8) and 5.6 months (95% CI, 2.5 to 10) in nonresponders (P = .005), respectively.

Acquired Genomic Alterations on First-Line Chemotherapy With Cetuximab in Advanced Colorectal Cancer: Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis of the CALGB/SWOG-80405 Trial (Alliance),Kanwal  Raghav; Fang-Shu  Ou; Alan P.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co‐primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

Acquired genomic alterations (Acq-GAs), specifically RAS, BRAF, and EGFR-ectodomain mutations and ERBB2 and MET amplifications, are recognized as major mechanisms of resistance to later-line anti–EGFR-antibody therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, data regarding emergence of these Acq-GAs under the selective pressure of first-line anti–EGFR-chemotherapy are lacking. We performed next-generation sequencing (Guardant360) on circulating tumor DNA obtained from paired plasma samples (pretreatment and postprogression) from the CALGB/SWOG-80405 trial, which randomly assigned patients with mCRC between first-line chemotherapy with cetuximab (anti–EGFR-chemotherapy) or bevacizumab (anti–VEGF-chemotherapy). The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of Acq-GAs on anti–EGFR-chemotherapy and compare this to the prevalence with anti–VEGF-chemotherapy on trial and pooled estimates (N = 292) seen with later-line anti–EGFR-antibody therapy as reported in the literature. Among the 61 patients on anti–EGFR-chemotherapy, only four (6.6%) developed ≥ 1 Acq-GAs of interest compared with 10.1% (7) on anti–VEGF-chemotherapy (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.20 to 2.11) and 62.0% on anti–EGFR-antibody therapy in later lines (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.23). Acq-GAs, classically associated with anti–EGFR-antibody resistance in later lines (RAS, BRAF, and EGFR-ectodomain mutations; ERBB2 and MET amplifications), were rare with up-front use of anti–EGFR-chemotherapy indicating divergent resistance mechanisms. These findings have critical translational relevance to timing and value of circulating tumor DNA–guided anti-EGFR rechallenge in patients with mCRC, especially those treated with anti-EGFR therapy upfront.",2023-1-20,JCO.22.00365,"[{'Author': 'Ryan Sun', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Boehringer Ingelheim', 'Research Funding: Sanofi']}, {'Author': 'Scott Kopetz', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: MolecularMatch, Lutris, Iylon, Frontier Medicines', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Genentech, EMD Serono, Merck, Holy Stone Healthcare, Novartis, Lilly, Boehringer Ingelheim, Boston Biomedical, AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Bayer Health, Pierre Fabre, EMD Serono, Redx Pharma, Ipsen, Daiichi Sankyo, Natera, HalioDx, Lutris, Jacobio, Pfizer, Repare Therapeutics, Inivata, GlaxoSmithKline, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Iylon, Xilis, AbbVie, Amal Therapeutics, Gilead Sciences, Mirati Therapeutics, Flame Biosciences, Servier, Carina Biotech, Bicara Therapeutics, Endeavor BioMedicines, Numab, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, Genomic Health, Frontier Medicines, Replimune, Taiho Pharmaceutical', 'Research Funding: Sanofi, Biocartis, Guardant Health, Array BioPharma, Genentech/Roche, EMD Serono, MedImmune, Novartis, Amgen, Lilly, Daiichi Sankyo']}, {'Author': 'Federico Innocenti', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: AbbVie', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: AbbVie', 'Honoraria: Tempus', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Symberix, Emerald Lake Safety', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: United States Patent: ""Flavopiridol drug combinations and methods with reduced side effects"", Ratain M.J., Innocenti F., Iyer L.

Methods: SECOMBIT is a randomized, three-arm, noncomparative phase II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02631447). Patients with untreated, metastatic BRAFV600-mutant melanoma from 37 sites in nine countries were randomly assigned to arm A (encorafenib [450 mg orally once daily] plus binimetinib [45 mg orally twice daily] until progressive disease [PD] -> ipilimumab plus nivolumab [ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks and nivolumab 1 mg/kg once every 3 weeks × four cycles -> nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks]), arm B [ipilimumab plus nivolumab until PD -> encorafenib plus binimetinib], or arm C (encorafenib plus binimetinib for 8 weeks -> ipilimumab plus nivolumab until PD -> encorafenib plus binimetinib). The primary end point was overall survival (OS) at 2 years. Secondary end points included total progression-free survival, 3-year OS, best overall response rate, duration of response, and biomarkers in the intent-to-treat population. Safety was analyzed throughout sequential treatment in all participants who received at least one dose of study medication.

Results: A total of 209 patients were randomly assigned (69 in arm A, 71 in arm B, and 69 in arm C). At a median follow-up of 32.2 (interquartile range, 27.9-41.6) months, median OS was not reached in any arm and more than 30 patients were alive in all arms. Assuming a null hypothesis of median OS of ≤ 15 months, the OS end point was met for all arms. The 2-year and 3-year OS rates were 65% (95% CI, 54 to 76) and 54% (95% CI, 41 to 67) in arm A, 73% (95% CI, 62 to 84) and 62% (95% CI, 48 to 76) in arm B, and 69% (95% CI, 59 to 80) and 60% (95% CI, 58 to 72) in arm C.

Herein, we report safety and efficacy outcomes of this phase I dose escalation/expansion study.

Methods: Patients with RRMM (≥ three prior lines including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody) were eligible. ABBV-383 was administered intravenously over 1-2 hours once every 3 weeks, without any step dosing. A 3 + 3 design with backfilling for dose escalation was used (intrapatient escalation to highest safe dose permitted) followed by initiation of dose expansion.

Results: As of January 8, 2022, 124 patients (dose escalation [0.025-120 mg], n = 73; dose expansion [60 mg], n = 51) have received ABBV-383; median age was 68 years (range, 35-92 years). The most common hematologic treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were neutropenia (all grades: 37%) and anemia (29%). The most common nonhematologic TEAEs were cytokine release syndrome (57%) and fatigue (30%). Seven deaths from TEAEs were reported with all considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator. For all efficacy-evaluable patients (n = 122; all doses), the objective response rate (ORR) was 57% and very good partial response (VGPR) or better (≥ VGPR) rate was 43%. In the 60 mg dose expansion cohort (n = 49), the ORR and ≥ VGPR rates were 59% and 39%, respectively; and in the ≥ 40 mg dose escalation plus dose expansion cohorts (n = 79) were 68% and 54%, respectively.

Conclusion: ABBV-383 in patients with RRMM was well tolerated with an ORR of 68% at doses ≥ 40 mg.

Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate with an SN-38 payload targeting trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2, an epithelial antigen expressed in breast cancer.

Methods: In this global, randomized, phase III study, SG was compared with physician's choice chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine) in endocrine-resistant, chemotherapy-treated HR+/HER2– locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic breast cancer. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review.

Results: Patients were randomly assigned to receive SG (n = 272) or chemotherapy (n = 271). The median age was 56 years, 95% had visceral metastases, and 99% had a prior cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, with three median lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease. Primary end point was met with a 34% reduction in risk of progression or death (hazard ratio, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53 to 0.83; P = .0003]). The median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 7.0) with SG and 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.1 to 4.4) with chemotherapy; the PFS at 6 and 12 months was 46% (95% CI, 39 to 53) v 30% (95% CI, 24 to 37) and 21% (95% CI, 15 to 28) v 7% (95% CI, 3 to 14), respectively. Median overall survival (first planned interim analysis) was not yet mature (hazard ratio, 0.84; P = .14). Key grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (SG v chemotherapy) were neutropenia (51% v 38%) and diarrhea (9% v 1%).

Conclusion: SG demonstrated statistically significant PFS benefit over chemotherapy, with a manageable safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated, endocrine-resistant HR+/HER2– advanced breast cancer and limited treatment options.",2022-10-10,JCO.22.01002,"[{'Author': 'Hope S.

The randomized, open-label, phase II EVAN study investigated the efficacy (disease-free survival [DFS] and 5-year overall survival [OS]) and safety of erlotinib versus vinorelbine/cisplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy after complete resection (R0) for stage III epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation+ non–small-cell lung cancer. We describe the updated results at the 43-month follow-up. In EVAN, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to erlotinib (n = 51) or vinorelbine/cisplatin (n = 51). The median follow-up was 54.8 and 63.9 months in the erlotinib and chemotherapy arms, respectively. With erlotinib, the respective 5-year DFS by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 48.2% (95% CI, 29.4 to 64.7) and 46.2% (95% CI, 27.6 to 62.9) in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. The median OS was 84.2 months with erlotinib versus 61.1 months with chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.318; 95% CI, 0.151 to 0.670). The 5-year survival rates were 84.8% and 51.1% with erlotinib and chemotherapy, respectively. In whole-exome sequencing analysis, frequent genes with variants co-occurring at baseline were TP53, MUC16, FAM104B, KMT5A, and DNAH9. With erlotinib, a single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation in UBXN11 was associated with significantly worse DFS (P = .01). To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate clinically meaningful OS improvement with adjuvant erlotinib compared with chemotherapy in R0 stage III EGFR+ non–small-cell lung cancer.",2022-12-1,JCO.22.00428,"[{'Author': 'Changli Wang', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche China, AstraZeneca', 'Research Funding: Roche China, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Lilly', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

Luspatercept has high clinical activity in patients with transfusion-dependent lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) and ring sideroblasts (RS) relapsed or refractory to erythropoietin. We report long-term luspatercept safety and efficacy in 108 patients with LR-MDS in the PACE-MDS study, including 44 non-RS and 34 non–transfusion-dependent or previously untreated patients. The primary end point was safety. Secondary end points included rates of hematologic improvement (HI) erythroid (HI-E), HI neutrophil, and HI platelet. Exploratory end points included erythropoiesis biomarker quantitation and mutation data. Median duration of luspatercept exposure was 315 days (range, 21-1,934 days). No new safety signals emerged. HI-E was observed in 53.7% of patients, including 36.4% of non-RS and 70.6% of non–transfusion-dependent patients. HI neutrophil and HI platelet were observed in 33.3% and 9.5% of patients, respectively. An almost three-fold increase in bone marrow late to early progenitor cell ratio accompanied HI-E response, irrespective of RS status. Lower baseline erythropoietin levels in non-RS patients (69.6 v 623.3 IU/L; P = .0077) and higher late to early erythroid progenitor cell ratio (10.44 v 4.48; P = .0106) in RS patients were associated with HI-E.

We report the efficacy and safety from a phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, international study of T-VEC plus pembrolizumab (T-VEC-pembrolizumab) versus placebo plus pembrolizumab (placebo-pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced melanoma.

Methods: Patients with stage IIIB-IVM1c unresectable melanoma, naïve to antiprogrammed cell death protein-1, were randomly assigned 1:1 to T-VEC-pembrolizumab or placebo-pembrolizumab. T-VEC was administered at ≤ 4 × 106 plaque-forming unit (PFU) followed by ≤ 4 × 108 PFU 3 weeks later and once every 2 weeks until dose 5 and once every 3 weeks thereafter. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously 200 mg once every 3 weeks. The dual primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) per modified RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review and overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included objective response rate per mRECIST, CRR, and safety. Here, we report the primary analysis for PFS, the second preplanned interim analysis for OS, and the final analysis.

Results: Overall, 692 patients were randomly assigned (346 T-VEC-pembrolizumab and 346 placebo-pembrolizumab). T-VEC-pembrolizumab did not significantly improve PFS (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.04; P = .13) or OS (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.22; P = .74) compared with placebo-pembrolizumab. The objective response rate was 48.6% for T-VEC-pembrolizumab (CRR 17.9%) and 41.3% for placebo-pembrolizumab (CRR 11.6%); the durable response rate was 42.2% and 34.1% for the arms, respectively. Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 20.7% of patients in the T-VEC-pembrolizumab arm and in 19.5% of patients in the placebo-pembrolizumab arm.

Conclusion: T-VEC-pembrolizumab did not significantly improve PFS or OS compared with placebo-pembrolizumab. Safety results of the T-VEC-pembrolizumab combination were consistent with the safety profiles of each agent alone.",2023-1-20,JCO.22.00343,"[{'Author': 'Jason A.

Gill,CA; CA; CA; CA; CA; CA; KS; VA; CA; NJ; CA; NV; NC; CA; CA; CA; VA; CA,"Purpose: Patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma have poor prognosis after failure of standard first-line chemotherapy. Immune check point programmed death 1-programmed death ligand 1 antibodies have low response rates and thus there exists a major unmet need.

Materials and Methods: In this phase II trial, patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma that recurred or progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy received soluble EphB4-human serum albumin (sEphB4-HSA) in combination with pembrolizumab. The primary end points were tolerability and overall survival (OS). The secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, and toxicity. The expression of sEphB4-HSA target EphrinB2 was correlated with outcomes.

Results: Seventy patients were enrolled. The median follow up was 22.9 months (range, 1.3-54.7). The regimen had acceptable toxicity. In the intent-to-treat analysis (N = 70), the median OS was 14.6 months (95% CI, 9.2 to 21.5). Twenty-six (37%) patients had an objective response (95% CI, 26 to 48). The median PFS was 4.1 (95% CI, 1.5 to 5.7) months. Forty-six (66%) patients expressed EphrinB2, and among them, the median OS was 21.5 months (95% CI, 12.4 to not reached), the ORR was 52% (95% CI, 37 to 67), including a complete response rate of 24% (11 of 46; 95% CI, 12 to 36). The median PFS was 5.7 (95% CI, 2.7 to 27.9) months. Response was maintained at 6, 12, and 24 months in 88%, 74%, and 69% of the patients, respectively.

Conclusion: The combination of sEphB4-HSA and pembrolizumab appears synergistic with improved OS and ORR compared with historical data for programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 monotherapy.",2023-1-20,JCO.21.02923,[]

The objective of this phase II trial was to determine the outcomes and organ-sparing rate of patients with early-stage rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by transanal excision surgery (TES).

Methods: This phase II trial included patients with clinical T1-T3abN0 low- or mid-rectal adenocarcinoma eligible for endoscopic resection who were treated with 3 months of chemotherapy (modified folinic acid–fluorouracil-oxaliplatin 6 or capecitabine-oxaliplatin). Those with evidence of response proceeded to transanal endoscopic surgery 2-6 weeks later. The primary end point was protocol-specified organ preservation rate, defined as the proportion of patients with tumor downstaging to ypT0/T1N0/X and who avoided radical surgery.

Results: Of 58 patients enrolled, all commenced chemotherapy and 56 proceeded to surgery. A total of 33/58 patients had tumor downstaging to ypT0/1N0/X on the surgery specimen, resulting in an intention-to-treat protocol-specified organ preservation rate of 57% (90% CI, 45 to 68). Of 23 remaining patients recommended for TME surgery on the basis of protocol requirements, 13 declined and elected to proceed directly to observation resulting in 79% (90% CI, 69 to 88) achieving organ preservation. The remaining 10/23 patients proceeded to recommended TME of whom seven had no histopathologic residual disease. The 1-year and 2-year locoregional relapse-free survival was, respectively, 98% (95% CI, 86 to 100) and 90% (95% CI, 58 to 98), and there were no distant recurrences or deaths. Minimal change in quality of life and rectal function scores was observed.

Conclusion: Three months of induction chemotherapy may successfully downstage a significant proportion of patients with early-stage rectal cancer, allowing well-tolerated organ-preserving surgery.",2023-1-10,JCO.22.00184,"[{'Author': 'Hagen F.

Perioperative chemotherapy remains debatable for gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR)/microsatellite instability–high (MSI-H).

Patients and Methods: NEONIPIGA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04006262) phase II study evaluated neoadjuvant nivolumab 240 mg once every two weeks ×6 and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg once every six weeks ×2, followed by surgery and adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg once every four weeks (nine injections) in patients with locally advanced resectable dMMR/MSI-H, clinical (c) tumor (T)2-T4 node (N)x metastasis (M)0 gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma. The primary end point was a pathological complete response (pCR) rate.

Results: Between October 2019 and June 2021, 32 patients with dMMR/MSI-H gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma were enrolled. The median age was 65.5 years (range, 40-80). Clinical stages were cT2-T3N0 (n = 9), cT2-T3N1 (n = 22), and cT3N1M1 (n = 1, wrongly included). With a median follow-up of 14.9 months (95% CI, 10.6 to 17.6), 32 patients received neoadjuvant immunotherapy (27 patients completed all cycles). Neoadjuvant therapy-related grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in six patients (19%). Twenty-nine patients underwent surgery; three did not have surgery and had complete endoscopic response with tumor-free biopsies and a normal computed tomography scan (two refused surgery and one had metastasis at inclusion). The rate of surgical morbidity (Clavien-Dindo classification) was 55% (one postoperative death occurred). All 29 patients had an R0 resection, and 17 (58.6%; 90% CI, 41.8 to 74.1) had pCR (pathological T0N0). Becker tumor regression grades 1a, 1b, 2, and 3 were observed in 17 patients, three (including two pathological T0N1), two, and seven patients, respectively. Of the 29 patients with surgery, 23 received adjuvant nivolumab. At database lock, no patient had relapse and one died without relapse.

Here, we present the final overall survival (OS) results.

Methods: Patients with RRMM who had received ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy, with disease refractory to last therapy and either refractory or relapsed and refractory to lenalidomide and a PI were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive EPd or Pd. The primary end point was PFS per investigator assessment. ORR and OS were secondary end points planned to be tested hierarchically.

Results: A total of 117 patients were randomly assigned to EPd (n = 60) and Pd (n = 57). Among treated patients (EPd 60, Pd 55), there were 37 (61.7%) deaths in the EPd group and 41 (74.5%) in the Pd group, most commonly because of disease progression (EPd 41.7%, Pd 49.1%). Median (95% CI) OS was significantly improved with EPd (29.8 [22.9 to 45.7] months) versus Pd (17.4 [13.8 to 27.7] months), with a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.93; P = .0217). OS benefit with EPd was observed in most patient subgroups. The safety profile of EPd was consistent with prior reports with no new safety signals detected.

Conclusion: EPd demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS versus Pd in patients with RRMM previously treated with lenalidomide and a PI who had disease refractory to last therapy. In this setting, ELOQUENT-3 is the first randomized study of a triplet regimen incorporating a monoclonal antibody and Pd to improve both PFS and OS significantly.",2023-1-20,JCO.21.02815,"[{'Author': 'Mihaela Popa McKiver', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: Briston Myers Squibb', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Briston Myers Squibb']}, {'Author': 'Ying-Ming Jou', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene']}, {'Author': 'Paul G.

We tested switch maintenance therapy with the poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor rucaparib, following chemotherapy, for DRD biomarker–positive mUC.

Methods: DRD biomarker–positive mUC patients, within 10 weeks of chemotherapy, and without cancer progression, were randomly assigned (1:1) to maintenance rucaparib 600 mg twice a day orally, or placebo, until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Statistical analysis targeted a hazard ratio of 0.5 with a 20% one-sided α for this signal-seeking trial. PFS (RECIST 1.1) was compared between trial arms, by intention to treat, within a Cox model.

Results: Out of 248 patients, 74 (29.8%) were DRD biomarker–positive and 40 were randomly assigned. A total of 12 (60%) and 20 (100%) PFS events occurred in the rucaparib and placebo arms, respectively (median follow-up was 94.6 weeks in those still alive). Median PFS was 35.3 weeks (80% CI, 11.7 to 35.6) with rucaparib and 15.1 weeks (80% CI, 11.9 to 22.6) with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.53; 80% CI, 0.30 to 0.92; one-sided P = .07). In the safety population (n = 39) treatment-related adverse events were mostly low grade. Patients received a median duration of 10 rucaparib or six placebo cycles on treatment. Treatment-related adverse events (all grades) of fatigue (63.2% v 30.0%), nausea (36.8% v 5.0%), rash (21.1% v 0%), and raised alanine aminotransferase (57.9% v 10%) were more common with rucaparib.

Conclusion: Maintenance rucaparib, following platinum-based chemotherapy, extended PFS in DRD biomarker-selected patients with mUC and was tolerable.

The purpose of this update was to determine differences in patient-reported chronic toxicity and disease outcomes with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) compared with conventional pelvic radiation. Patients with cervical and endometrial cancers who received postoperative pelvic radiation were randomly assigned to conventional radiation therapy (CRT) or IMRT. Toxicity and quality of life were assessed using Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) bowel and urinary domains, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–General. Between 2012 and 2015, 279 eligible patients were enrolled to the study with a median follow-up of 37.8 months. There were no differences in overall survival (P = .53), disease-free survival (P = .21), or locoregional failure (P = .81). One year after RT, patients in the CRT arm experienced more high-level diarrhea frequency (5.8% IMRT v 15.1% CRT, P = .042) and a greater number had to take antidiarrheal medication two or more times a day (1.2% IMRT v 8.6% CRT, P = .036). At 3 years, women in the CRT arm reported a decline in urinary function, whereas the IMRT arm continued to improve (mean change in EPIC urinary score = 0.5, standard deviation = 13.0, IMRT v –6.0, standard deviation = 14.3, CRT, P = .005). In conclusion, IMRT reduces patient-reported chronic GI and urinary toxicity with no difference in treatment efficacy at 3 years.",2022-9-20,JCO.21.02831,"[{'Author': 'Lari Wenzel', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Array BioPharma']}, {'Author': 'Shannon N.

Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

In a randomized, open-label, phase III NEJ009 study, gefitinib plus chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with gefitinib-alone in patients with untreated non–small-cell lung cancer harboring mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor. Herein, we report the updated survival outcome and long-term tolerability. Patients were randomly assigned to gefitinib (gefitinib 250 mg orally, once daily) and gefitinib combined with carboplatin plus pemetrexed (GCP in a 3-week cycle for six cycles followed by concurrent gefitinib and pemetrexed maintenance) groups. At the data cutoff (May 22, 2020), GCP demonstrated significantly better PFS2 (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97; P = .027) than gefitinib. However, the updated median OS was 38.5 months (95% CI, 31.1 to 47.1) and 49.0 months (95% CI, 41.8 to 56.7) in the gefitinib and GCP groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.06; P = .127). The OS in both groups was similar for the overall patient population. No severe adverse events occurred since the first report. This updated analysis revealed that the GCP regimen improved PFS and PFS2 with an acceptable safety profile compared with gefitinib-alone. GCP is more efficient than gefitinib monotherapy as a first-line treatment for non–small-cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations.",2022-11-1,JCO.21.02911,"[{'Author': 'Eisaku Miyauchi', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Chugai Pharma, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ono Pharmaceutical, Lilly, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Kyowa Kirin, Novartis, Daiichi Sankyo, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Chugai Pharma, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lilly, Kyowa Kirin', 'Research Funding: Boehringer Ingelheim, Lilly (Inst), Chugai Pharma (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Satoshi Morita', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca Japan, Bristol Myers Squibb Company, Chugai Pharma, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Lilly Japan, MSD K.K, Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim, Ono Pharmaceutical, Pfizer Japan Inc, Eisai, Novartis, Kyowa Kirin Co Ltd', 'Research Funding: Eisai (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Atsushi Nakamura', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Chugai Pharma, Lilly Japan, Kyowa Kirin, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Novartis, Thermo Fisher Scientific']}, {'Author': 'Yukio Hosomi', 'Disclosures': [""Speakers' Bureau: AstraZeneca, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Lilly Japan, Chugai Pharma, Ono Pharmaceutical, Bristol Myers Squibb Japan, MSD, Kyowa Kirin International""]}, {'Author': 'Satoshi Ikeda', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Chugai Pharma, Boehringer Ingelheim, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Ono Pharmaceutical, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Lilly, Pfizer, Takeda', 'Research Funding: Chugai Pharma, AstraZeneca']}, {'Author': 'Masahiro Seike', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, MSD K.K, Chugai Pharma, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Lilly, Ono Pharmaceutical, Bristol Myers Squibb, Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Nippon Kayaku, Daiichi-Sankyo Company', 'Research Funding: Taiho Pharmaceutical, Chugai Pharma, Lilly, MSD K.K, Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim, Nippon Kayaku']}, {'Author': 'Yuka Fujita', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Novartis (Inst), Asahi Kasei (Inst), Ono Pharmaceutical (Inst), Otsuka (Inst), Lilly Japan (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Koichi Minato', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Bristol Myers Squibb Japan, Chugai Pharma', 'Research Funding: Ono Pharmaceutical (Inst), Taiho Pharmaceutical (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Ryo Ko', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Taiho Pharmaceutical, Chugai Pharma, Lilly Japan, Boehringer Ingelheim, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Ono Pharmaceutical, Daiichi Sankyo/UCB Japan, Takeda', 'Research Funding: MSD']}, {'Author': 'Koichi Hagiwara', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Chugai Pharma, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Boehringer Ingelheim, Ono Pharmaceutical, Novartis, Kyorin, Takeda, Lilly, Nippon Shinyaku, Kyowa Kirin, Nippon Kayaku, Bayer Yakuhin', 'Research Funding: Ono Pharmaceutical, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Boehringer Ingelheim (Inst), Eiken Chemical', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: LSI Medience']}, {'Author': 'Kunihiko Kobayashi', 'Disclosures': [""Speakers' Bureau: AstraZeneca, Takeda""]}, {'Author': 'Toshihiro Nukiwa', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Nippon Boehringer Ingelheim, Grifols']}, {'Author': 'Akira Inoue', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lilly Japan, Chugai Pharma, Ono Pharmaceutical, Bristol Myers Squibb Japan, Shionogi, Daiichi Sankyo, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Nippon Kayaku, Mundipharma, Novartis, Pfizer', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Lilly Japan, MSD', 'Research Funding: Boehringer Ingelheim (Inst), Lilly Japan (Inst), Kyowa Hakko Kirin (Inst), Chugai Pharma (Inst), Shionogi (Inst)', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

Ripretinib is a switch-control TKI approved for advanced GIST after prior treatment with three or more TKIs, including imatinib. We compared efficacy and safety of ripretinib versus sunitinib in patients with advanced GIST who were previously treated with imatinib (INTRIGUE, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03673501).

Patients and Methods: Random assignment was 1:1 to once-daily ripretinib 150 mg or once-daily sunitinib 50 mg (4 weeks on/2 weeks off) and stratified by KIT/platelet-derived growth factor α mutation and imatinib intolerance. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by independent radiologic review using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Secondary end points included objective response rate by independent radiologic review, safety, and patient-reported outcome measures.

Results: Overall, 453 patients were randomly assigned to ripretinib (intention-to-treat [ITT], n = 226; KIT exon 11 ITT, n = 163) or sunitinib (ITT, n = 227; KIT exon 11 ITT, n = 164). Median PFS for ripretinib and sunitinib (KIT exon 11 ITT) was 8.3 and 7.0 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.16; P = .36); median PFS (ITT) was 8.0 and 8.3 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.33; nominal P = .72). Neither was statistically significant. Objective response rate was higher for ripretinib versus sunitinib in the KIT exon 11 ITT population (23.9% v 14.6%, nominal P = .03). Ripretinib was associated with a more favorable safety profile, fewer grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (41.3% v 65.6%, nominal P < .0001), and better scores on patient-reported outcome measures of tolerability.

Conclusion: Ripretinib was not superior to sunitinib in terms of PFS.

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study nested within a randomized multicenter trial of stage III colon cancer that compared 3 versus 6 months of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin with or without celecoxib. We measured recreational physical activity in the first 3 months of chemotherapy and again 6 months after completion of chemotherapy. The primary end point was DFS.

Results: During a median follow-up of 5.9 years, 457 of 1,696 patients experienced disease recurrence or death. For total recreational physical activity volume, the 3-year DFS was 76.5% with < 3.0 metabolic equivalent task hours per week (MET-h/wk) and 87.1% with ≥ 18.0 MET-h/wk (risk difference [RD], 10.6%; 95% CI, 4.7 to 19.4; P < .001). For light-intensity to moderate-intensity activities, the 3-year DFS was 65.7% with 0.0 h/wk and 87.1% with ≥ 1.5 h/wk (RD, 21.4%; 95% CI, 9.2 to 37.1; P < .001). For vigorous-intensity activity, the 3-year DFS was 76.0% with 0.0 h/wk and 86.0% with ≥ 1.0 h/wk (RD, 10.0%; 95% CI, 4.5 to 18.9; P < .001). For brisk walking, the 3-year DFS was 81.7% with < 1.0 h/wk and 88.4% with ≥ 3.0 h/wk (RD, 6.7%; 95% CI, 3.0 to 13.8; P < .001). For muscle strengthening activity, the 3-year DFS was 81.8% with 0.0 h/wk and 88.8% for ≥ 0.5 h/wk (RD, 7.0%; 95% CI, 3.1 to 14.2; P = .003).

Conclusion: Among patients with stage III colon cancer enrolled in a trial of postoperative treatment, larger volumes of recreational physical activity, longer durations of light- to moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, or any vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity were associated with the greatest improvements in DFS.",2023-1-10,JCO.22.00171,"[{'Author': 'Qian Shi', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Chugai Pharma', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Yiviva, Boehringer Ingelheim, Regeneron, Hoosier Cancer Research Network', 'Research Funding: Celgene (Inst), Roche/Genentech (Inst), Janssen (Inst), BMS (Inst), Novartis (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Charles S.

We hypothesized that PBI was noninferior to WBI regarding breast induration.

Methods: Patients operated with breast conservation for relatively low-risk breast cancer were randomly assigned to WBI versus PBI, and all had 40 Gy/15 fractions. The primary end point was 3-year grade 2-3 breast induration.

Results: In total, 865 evaluable patients (434 WBI and 431 PBI) were enrolled between 2009 and 2016. Median follow-up was 5.0 years (morbidity) and 7.6 years (locoregional recurrence). The 3-year rate of induration was 9.7% for WBI and 5.1% for PBI (P = .014). Large breast size was significantly associated with induration with a 3-year incidence of 13% (WBI) and 6% (PBI) for large-breasted patients versus 6% (WBI) and 5% (PBI) for small-breasted patients. PBI showed no increased risk of dyspigmentation, telangiectasia, edema, or pain, and patient satisfaction was high. Letrozole and smoking did not increase the risk of radiation-associated morbidity. Sixteen patients had a locoregional recurrence (six WBI and 10 PBI; P = .28), 20 patients had a contralateral breast cancer, and eight patients had distant failure (five WBI and three PBI). A nonbreast second cancer was detected in 73 patients (8.4%), and there was no difference between groups.

Conclusion: External-beam PBI for patients with low-risk breast cancer was noninferior to WBI in terms of breast induration. Large breast size was a risk factor for radiation-associated induration. Few recurrences were detected and unrelated to PBI.",2022-12-20,JCO.22.00451,"[{'Author': 'Erik H. Jakobsen', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Pfizer']}, {'Author': 'Anders N.

Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical outcomes of LEN combined with transarterial chemoembolization (LEN-TACE) versus LEN monotherapy in patients with advanced HCC.

Materials and Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group, phase III trial. Patients with primary treatment-naive or initial recurrent advanced HCC after surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive LEN plus on-demand TACE (LEN-TACE) or LEN monotherapy. LEN was initiated within 3 days after random assignment (initial dose: 12 mg once daily for patients ≥ 60 kg; 8 mg once daily for patients < 60 kg). TACE was initiated one day after LEN initiation. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).

Results: Between June 2019 and July 2021, a total of 338 patients underwent random assignment at 12 centers in China: 170 to LEN-TACE and 168 to LEN. At a prespecified event-driven interim analysis after a median follow-up of 17.0 months, the median OS was significantly longer in the LEN-TACE group (17.8 v 11.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.45; P < .001). The median progression-free survival was 10.6 months in the LEN-TACE group and 6.4 months in the LEN group (hazard ratio, 0.43; P < .001). Patients in the LEN-TACE group had a higher objective response rate according to the modified RECIST (54.1% v 25.0%, P < .001). Multivariable analysis revealed that portal vein tumor thrombus and treatment allocation were independent risk factors for OS.

Conclusion: The addition of TACE to LEN improves clinical outcomes and is a potential first-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC.",2023-1-1,JCO.22.00392,"[{'Author': 'Jiping Wang', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: GenomiCare', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: GenomiCare', 'Research Funding: GenomiCare', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"

We assessed the efficacy and safety of brentuximab vedotin plus doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (BV-AVD) in previously untreated, early-stage unfavorable Hodgkin lymphoma (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02292979).

Methods: BREACH is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase II trial. Eligible patients were age 18-60 years with ≥ 1 unfavorable EORTC/LYSA criterion. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to four cycles of BV-AVD or standard doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), followed by 30 Gy involved node radiotherapy. The primary end point was the positron emission tomography (PET) response rate after two cycles by expert independent review using the Deauville score. The study was designed to test if the PET-negative rate after two cycles of BV-AVD was superior to 75%. We hypothesized a 10% increase in the PET-negative rate after two cycles of BV-AVD.

Results: Between March 2015 and October 2016, 170 patients were enrolled. After two cycles, the primary end point of the study was met: 93 (82.3%; 90% CI, 75.3 to 88.0) of 113 patients in the BV-AVD arm were PET-negative (Deauville score 1-3) compared with 43 (75.4%; 90% CI, 64.3% to 84.5%) of 57 in the ABVD arm. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 97.3% (95% CI, 91.9 to 99.1) and 92.6% (95% CI, 81.4% to 97.2%) in the BV-AVD and ABVD arms, respectively. High total metabolic tumor volume was associated with a significantly shorter PFS (hazard ratio, 17.9; 95% CI, 2.2 to 145.5; P < .001). For patients with high total metabolic tumor volume, the 2-year PFS rate was 90.9% (95% CI, 74.4 to 97.0) and 70.7% (95% CI, 39.4% to 87.9%) in the BV-AVD and ABVD arms, respectively.

We conducted the phase II LEAP-004 study to evaluate the combination of the multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib and the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in this population (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03776136).

Methods: Eligible patients with unresectable stage III-IV melanoma with confirmed progressive disease (PD) within 12 weeks of the last dose of a PD-1/L1 inhibitor given alone or with other therapies, including cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, received lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily plus ≤ 35 doses of pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks until PD or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST, version 1.1, by independent central review.

Results: A total of 103 patients were enrolled and treated. The median study follow-up was 15.3 months. ORR in the total population was 21.4% (95% CI, 13.9 to 30.5), with three (2.9%) complete responses and 19 (18.4%) partial responses. The median duration of response was 8.3 months (range, 3.2-15.9+). ORR was 33.3% in the 30 patients with PD on prior anti–PD-1 plus anti–CTLA-4 therapy. The median progression-free survival and overall survival in the total population were 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.8 to 7.1) and 14.0 months (95% CI, 10.8 to not reached), respectively. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 47 (45.6%) patients, most commonly hypertension (21.4%); one patient died from a treatment-related event (decreased platelet count).

Conclusion: Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab provides clinically meaningful, durable responses in patients with advanced melanoma with confirmed PD on prior PD-1/L1 inhibitor-based therapy, including those with PD on anti–PD-1 plus anti–CTLA-4 therapy.

Schwartz,NY; NY; MN; AZ; MN; MI; MN; MO; CO; CA; CT; NY; NY; IA; NY; NY; NY; NY; CA; NY,"Purpose: The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed (+) in a subset of salivary gland cancers (SGCs). This phase II trial evaluated the efficacy of the antiandrogen enzalutamide in AR+ SGC.

Methods: Patients with locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic AR+ SGCs were enrolled. Enzalutamide (160 mg) was given orally once daily. The primary end point was the best overall response rate per RECIST v1.1 within eight cycles. Confirmed responses in ≥ 5 of 41 patients would be considered promising. Secondary end points were progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety.

Results: Forty-six patients were enrolled; 30 (65.2%) received prior systemic therapy, including 13 (28.3%) with AR-targeted drugs. Of seven (15.2%) partial responses (PRs), only two (4.3%) were confirmed per protocol and counted toward the primary end point. Twenty-four patients (52.2%) had stable disease; 15 (32.6%) had progression of disease as best response. Twenty-six patients (56.5%) experienced tumor regression in target lesions; 18 (39.1%) had partial response/stable disease ≥ 6 months. Tumor regressions were observed in female patients (5 of 6 [83.3%]) and those who received prior AR– (6 of 13 [46.2%]) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–targeted therapies (5 of 8 [62.5%]). Three patients remained on treatment at data cutoff (duration, 32.2-49.8 months). The median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 7.5); the median overall survival was 17.0 months (95% CI, 11.8 to 30.0).

Methods: Secondary analysis of the Stockholm trial (STO-5, 1990-1997) randomly assigning 924 premenopausal patients to 2 years of goserelin (3.6 mg subcutaneously once every 28 days), tamoxifen (40 mg orally once daily), combined goserelin and tamoxifen, or no adjuvant endocrine therapy (control) is performed. Random assignment was stratified by lymph node status; lymph node–positive patients (n = 459) were allocated to standard chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). Primary tumor immunohistochemistry (n = 731) and gene expression profiling (n = 586) were conducted in 2020. The 70-gene signature identified genomic low-risk and high-risk patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis, multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression, and multivariable time-varying flexible parametric modeling assessed the long-term distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI). Swedish high-quality registries allowed a complete follow-up of 20 years.

Results: In estrogen receptor–positive patients (n = 584, median age 47 years), goserelin, tamoxifen, and the combination significantly improved long-term distant recurrence-free interval compared with control (multivariable hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.75, HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.87, and HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.94, respectively). Significant goserelin-tamoxifen interaction was observed (P = .016). Genomic low-risk patients (n = 305) significantly benefitted from tamoxifen (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.60), and genomic high-risk patients (n = 158) from goserelin (HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.54). Increased risk from the addition of tamoxifen to goserelin was seen in genomic high-risk patients (HR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.39 to 8.07). Moreover, long-lasting 20-year tamoxifen benefit was seen in genomic low-risk patients, whereas genomic high-risk patients had early goserelin benefit.

Conclusion: This study shows 20-year benefit from 2 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy in estrogen receptor–positive premenopausal patients and suggests differential treatment benefit on the basis of tumor genomic characteristics. Combined goserelin and tamoxifen therapy showed no benefit over single treatment. Long-term follow-up to assess treatment benefit is critical.",2022-12-10,JCO.21.02844,"[{'Author': ""Laura J. van 't Veer"", 'Disclosures': ['Employment: Agendia', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Agendia']}, {'Author': 'Nicholas P.

Here, we report the 5-year update from the COLUMBUS trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01909453).

Methods: Patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600–mutant melanoma, untreated or progressed after first-line immunotherapy, were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus binimetinib 45 mg twice daily, vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily, or encorafenib 300 mg once daily. An updated analysis was conducted 65 months after the last patient was randomly assigned.

Results: Five hundred seventy-seven patients were randomly assigned: 192 to encorafenib plus binimetinib, 191 to vemurafenib, and 194 to encorafenib. The 5-year PFS and OS rates with encorafenib plus binimetinib were 23% and 35% overall and 31% and 45% in those with normal lactate dehydrogenase levels, respectively. In comparison, the 5-year PFS and OS rates with vemurafenib were 10% and 21% overall and 12% and 28% in those with normal lactate dehydrogenase levels, respectively. The median duration of response with encorafenib plus binimetinib was 18.6 months, with disease control achieved in 92.2% of patients. In comparison, the median duration of response with vemurafenib was 12.3 months, with disease control achieved in 81.2% of patients. Long-term follow-up showed no new safety concerns, and results were consistent with the known tolerability profile of encorafenib plus binimetinib. Interactive visualization of the data presented in this article is available at COLUMBUS dashboard.

To reduce this uncertainty, we conducted a randomized trial to test whether an intensive (INT) versus a minimalist (MIN) follow-up regimen improves overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing operation for endometrial cancer.

Methods: The TOTEM study was a large, pragmatic randomized trial, conducted in 42 hospitals (in Italy and France) including patients surgically treated for endometrial cancer, in complete clinical remission, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I-IV. After stratification by center and risk of relapse (low or high), patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to INT or MIN hospital-based follow-up regimens. The study was powered to demonstrate an absolute improvement of 5% of the 5-year OS with the INT regimen.

Results: In total, 1,871 patients were randomly assigned between November 2008 and July 2018, and 1,847 patients (98.7%) were available for the final analysis (60% low risk). After a median follow-up of 69 months, the 5-year OS was 90.6% in the INT and 91.9% in the MIN arms (hazard ratio, 1.13, 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.50, P = .380). No differences in OS were found in subgroup analyses considering age, cancer treatment, risk of relapse, and degree of adherence of the center to the scheduled follow-up. The probability of detecting a relapse was slightly higher in the INT arm (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.48; P = .194).

Conclusion: An INT follow-up in endometrial cancer–treated patients does not improve OS, even in high-risk patients.

Paclitaxel is poorly absorbed orally; encequidar (E), a novel P-glycoprotein pump inhibitor, allows oral absorption.

Methods: A phase III open-label study comparing oral paclitaxel plus E (oPac + E) 205 mg/m2 paclitaxel plus 15 mg E methanesulfonate monohydrate 3 consecutive days per week versus IVpac 175 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks was performed. Women with metastatic breast cancer and adequate organ function, at least 1 year from last taxane, were randomly assigned 2:1 to oPac + E versus IVpac. The primary end point was confirmed radiographic response using RECIST 1.1, assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

Results: Four hundred two patients from Latin America were enrolled (265 oPac + E, 137 IVpac); demographics and prior therapies were balanced. The confirmed response (intent-to-treat) was 36% for oPac + E versus 23% for IVpac (P = .01). The PFS was 8.4 versus 7.4 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.768; 95.5% CI, 0.584 to 1.01; P = .046), and the OS was 22.7 versus 16.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.794; 95.5% CI, 0.607 to 1.037; P = .08). Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were 55% with oPac + E and 53% with IVpac. oPac + E had lower incidence and severity of neuropathy (2% v 15% > grade 2) and alopecia (49% v 62% all grades) than IVpac but more nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and neutropenic complications, particularly in patients with elevated liver enzymes. On-study deaths (8% oPac + E v 9% IVpac) were treatment-related in 3% and 0%, respectively.

Conclusion: oPac + E increased the confirmed tumor response versus IVpac, with trends in PFS and OS. Neuropathy was less frequent and severe with oPac + E; neutropenic serious infections were increased. Elevated liver enzymes at baseline predispose oPac + E patients to early neutropenia and serious infections (funded by Athenex, Inc; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02594371).",2023-1-1,JCO.21.02953,"[{'Author': 'Hope S.

Altman,TX; PA; KY; MD; NY; MN; NJ; CA; CA; FL; FL; IL; CA; CA; IL; IL; IL; IL; IL; IL,"Purpose: The FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor gilteritinib is standard therapy for relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutated (FLT3mut) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but seldom reduces FLT3mut burden or induces sustained efficacy. Gilteritinib combines synergistically with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in preclinical models of FLT3mut AML.

Methods: This phase Ib open-label, dose-escalation/dose-expansion study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03625505) enrolled patients with FLT3 wild-type and FLT3mut (escalation) or FLT3mut (expansion) relapsed/refractory AML. Patients received 400 mg oral venetoclax once daily and 80 mg or 120 mg oral gilteritinib once daily. The primary objectives were safety, identification of the recommended phase II dose, and the modified composite complete response (mCRc) rate (complete response [CR] + CR with incomplete blood count recovery + CR with incomplete platelet recovery + morphologic leukemia-free state) using ADMIRAL phase III–defined response criteria.

Results: Sixty-one patients were enrolled (n = 56 FLT3mut); 64% (n = 36 of 56) of FLT3mut patients had received prior FLT3 inhibitor therapy. The recommended phase II dose was 400 mg venetoclax once daily and 120 mg gilteritinib once daily. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were cytopenias (n = 49; 80%). Adverse events prompted venetoclax and gilteritinib dose interruptions in 51% and 48%, respectively. The mCRc rate for FLT3mut patients was 75% (CR, 18%; CR with incomplete blood count recovery, 4%; CR with incomplete platelet recovery, 18%; and morphologic leukemia-free state, 36%) and was similar among patients with or without prior FLT3 inhibitor therapy (80% v 67%, respectively). The median follow-up was 17.5 months. The median time to response was 0.9 months, and the median remission duration was 4.9 months (95% CI, 3.4 to 6.6). FLT3 molecular response (< 10−2) was achieved in 60% of evaluable mCRc patients (n = 15 of 25). The median overall survival for FLT3mut patients was 10.0 months.

Conclusion: The combination of venetoclax and gilteritinib was associated with high mCRc and FLT3 molecular response rates regardless of prior FLT3 inhibitor exposure.

Here, we report the final analysis of overall survival (OS) and other secondary end points.

Patients and Methods: Patients with a deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutation whose disease had not progressed after ≥ 16 weeks of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned 3:2 to active maintenance olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or placebo. The primary end point was PFS; secondary end points included OS, time to second disease progression or death, time to first and second subsequent cancer therapies or death, time to discontinuation of study treatment or death, and safety and tolerability.

Results: In total, 154 patients were randomly assigned (olaparib, n = 92; placebo, n = 62). No statistically significant OS benefit was observed (median 19.0 v 19.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.22; P = .3487). Kaplan-Meier OS curves separated at approximately 24 months, and the estimated 3-year survival after random assignment was 33.9% versus 17.8%, respectively. Median time to first subsequent cancer therapy or death (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.66; P < .0001), time to second subsequent cancer therapy or death (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.89; P = .0111), and time to discontinuation of study treatment or death (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.63; P < .0001) significantly favored olaparib. The HR for second disease progression or death favored olaparib without reaching statistical significance (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.02; P = .0613). Olaparib was well tolerated with no new safety signals.

Conclusion: Although no statistically significant OS benefit was observed, the HR numerically favored olaparib, which also conferred clinically meaningful benefits including increased time off chemotherapy and long-term survival in a subset of patients.",2022-12-1,JCO.21.01604,"[{'Author': 'Hedy L.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

We previously reported the results of a randomized phase II study in patients with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma (age 18-60 years). Patients were treated with high-dose methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy followed by whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or high-dose chemotherapy (thiotepa-busulfan-cyclophosphamide) with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). The median follow-up was 33 months. In this report, we provide long-term data (median follow-up, 8 years) regarding the outcomes and toxicities. Fifty-three and 44 patients received induction chemotherapy followed by WBRT or ASCT, respectively. Their 8-year event-free survival from random assignment was 67% and 39% in the ASCT and WBRT arms, respectively (P = .03), with a significantly lower risk of relapse after ASCT (hazard ratio, 0.13; P < .001). One third of patients who relapsed after WBRT were alive after salvage treatment. Five and four patients died of ASCT and WBRT-related toxicities, respectively. The 8-year overall survival was 69% and 65% in the ASCT and WBRT arms, respectively (not significant). Balance (52% v 10%, P ≤ 0.001) and neurocognition (64% v 13%, P < .001) significantly deteriorated after WBRT compared with ASCT during the follow-up. This study shows that 40 Gy WBRT should be avoided in first-line treatment because of its neurotoxicity and suboptimal efficacy in reducing relapses while ASCT appears to be highly efficient in preventing relapses.",2022-11-10,JCO.22.00491,"[{'Author': 'Roch Houot', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene, MSD, Kite/Gilead, Roche, Novartis, Janssen', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Kite/Gilead']}, {'Author': 'Olivier Chinot', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: AbbVie', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb, AbbVie']}, {'Author': 'Anna Schmitt', 'Disclosures': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Sanofi, Janssen Oncology']}, {'Author': 'Rémy Gressin', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Celgene', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer, Sandoz, Celgene']}, {'Author': 'Sylvain Choquet', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Takeda, Janssen, Biogaran Pharmaceuticals, Sandoz, Celgene, Sanofi, Atara Biotherapeutics, Kite/Gilead, Mylan, Novartis, AbbVie, AstraZeneca']}, {'Author': 'Gandhi Damaj', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Takeda, iQone, Amgen, Blueprint Medicines, Novartis', 'Research Funding: Takeda (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer, Roche/Genentech, AbbVie']}, {'Author': 'Frédéric Peyrade', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: MSD Oncology']}, {'Author': 'Julie Abraham', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Sanofi Pasteur, Gilead Sciences, Roche, Janssen', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen-Cilag, AbbVie']}, {'Author': 'Emmanuel Gyan', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Gilead Sciences, Celgene, Roche/Genentech, AbbVie/Genentech', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Amgen']}, {'Author': 'Jérôme Cornillon', 'Disclosures': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer']}, {'Author': 'Alain Delmer', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Janssen, AbbVie, AstraZeneca', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen, AbbVie, AstraZeneca']}, {'Author': 'Pierre Morel', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Janssen, AstraZeneca, Incyte', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: BeiGene']}, {'Author': 'Thomas Gastinne', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Gileas/kyte, Takeda', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Takeda, Gilead/Kyte']}, {'Author': 'Valérie Touitou', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Santhera, Pierre Fabre', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Santhera']}, {'Author': 'Khê Hoang-Xuan', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: BTG']}, {'Author': 'Carole Soussain', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Hangzhou HeZheng Pharmaceutical (Inst)', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]"
