Ansell,"Purpose: Nivolumab, an antiâ€“programmed death-1 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated frequent and durable responses in relapsed/refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). We report results from Cohort D of the CheckMate 205 trial, which assessed nivolumab monotherapy followed by nivolumab plus doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (N-AVD) for newly diagnosed cHL.

Methods: Patients 18 years of age or older with untreated, advanced-stage (defined as III to IV and IIB with unfavorable risk factors) cHL were eligible for Cohort D of this multicenter, noncomparative, phase II trial. Patients received nivolumab monotherapy for four doses, followed by 12 doses of N-AVD; all doses were every 2 weeks, and nivolumab was administered at 240 mg intravenously. The primary end point was safety. Efficacy end points included objective response rate and modified progression-free survival, defined as time to disease progression/relapse, death, or next therapy. Chromosome 9p24.1 alterations and programmed death-ligand 1 expression were assessed in Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells in evaluable patients.

Results: A total of 51 patients were enrolled and treated. At diagnosis, 49% of patients had an International Prognostic Score of 3 or greater. Overall, 59% experienced a grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse event. Treatment-related febrile neutropenia was reported in 10% of patients. Endocrine immune-mediated adverse events were all grade 1 to 2 and did not require high-dose corticosteroids; all nonendocrine immune-mediated adverse events resolved (most commonly, rash; 5.9%). At the end of therapy, the objective response rate (95% CI) per independent radiology review committee was 84% (71% to 93%), with 67% (52% to 79%), achieving complete remission (five patients [10%] were nonevaluable and counted as nonresponders). With a minimum follow-up of 9.4 months, 9-month modified progression-free survival was 92%. Patients with higher-level Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg programmed death-ligand 1 expression had more favorable responses to N-AVD (P = .041).

Conclusion: Nivolumab followed by N-AVD was associated with promising efficacy and safety profiles for newly diagnosed, advanced-stage cHL.",8/10/2019,"[{'Author': 'Radhakrishnan Ramchandren', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Seattle Genetics, Sandoz-Novartis, Pharmacyclics/Janssen, Bristol-Myers Squibb', 'Research Funding: Merck (Inst), Seattle Genetics (Inst), Janssen (Inst), Genentech (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Eva Domingo-DomÃ¨nech', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Takeda', 'Research Funding: Bristol-Myers Squibb, Takeda', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Takeda']}, {'Author': 'Antonio Rueda', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck Serono', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck Serono, MSD, Takeda, Novartis']}, {'Author': 'Marek TrnÄ›nÃ½', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Janssen, Gilead Sciences, Takeda, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, AbbVie, Roche, MorphoSys, Incyte', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Takeda, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Incyte, AbbVie, Amgen, Roche, Gilead Sciences, Janssen, Celgene, MorphoSys', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Gilead Sciences, Takeda, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche, Janssen, AbbVie']}, {'Author': 'Tatyana A.

Long-Term Follow-Up of the RESORT Study (E4402): A Randomized Phase III Comparison of Two Different Rituximab Dosing Strategies for Lowâ€“Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma,Brad S.  Kahl; Opeyemi A.  Jegede; Christopher  Peterson; Lode J.  Swinnen; Thomas M.  Habermann; Stephen J.  Schuster; Matthias  Weiss; Paul A.  Fishkin; Timothy S.  Fenske; Michael E.  Williams,"Clinical trials frequently include multiple end points that mature at different times. The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical trial updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

In 2003, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group initiated a randomized phase III clinical trial (E4402) comparing two different rituximab dosing strategies for patients with previously untreated lowâ€“tumor burden follicular lymphoma. Rituximab-responsive patients (n = 299) were randomly assigned to either a retreatment rituximab (RR) strategy or a maintenance rituximab (MR) strategy. Each dosing strategy was continued until treatment failure. The primary end point of the study was time to treatment failure (TTF). In the original report, there was no difference in TTF between the two dosing strategies. Here, we report on the long-term outcomes for secondary end points of time to first cytotoxic therapy, duration of response, and overall survival (OS). At 7 years, 83% of MR patients had not required first chemotherapy compared with 63% of RR patients (hazard ratio, 2.37 [95% CI, 1.5 to 3.76]). At 7 years, 71% of MR remained in their first remission compared with 37% of RR patients. Despite the improved first remission length with MR, there was no difference in OS at 10 years (83% v 84%). With mature long-term data, we confirm that prolonged maintenance rituximab does not confer an OS advantage in lowâ€“tumor burden follicular lymphoma.",3/1/2024,"[{'Author': 'Brad S.

Phase II Study of Lenalidomide and Rituximab As Salvage Therapy for Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Xavier C. Badoux; Michael J. Keating; Sijin Wen; William G. Wierda; Susan M. O'Brien; Stefan Faderl; Rachel Sargent; Jan A. Burger; Alessandra Ferrajoli,"Purpose: Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug active as salvage therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We combined lenalidomide with rituximab to improve response rates in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL.

Patients and Methods: Fifty-nine adult patients (age 42 to 82 years) with relapsed or refractory CLL were enrolled onto a phase II study of lenalidomide and rituximab. Patients had received prior fludarabine-based therapy or chemoimmunotherapy. Rituximab (375 mg/m2 intravenously) was administered weekly during cycle one and on day 1 of cycles three to 12. Lenalidomide was started on day 9 of cycle one at 10 mg orally and administered daily continuously. Each cycle was 28 days. Rituximab was administered for 12 cycles; lenalidomide could continue indefinitely if patients benefitted clinically.

Results: The overall response rate was 66%, including 12% complete responses and 12% nodular partial remissions. Time to treatment failure was 17.4 months. Median overall survival has not been reached; estimated survival at 36 months is 71%. The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity was neutropenia (73% of patients). Fourteen patients (24%) experienced a grade 3 to 4 infection or febrile episode. There was one episode of grade 3 tumor lysis; one patient experienced renal failure during the first cycle of therapy, and one venous thromboembolic event occurred during the study.

Conclusion: The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab is active in patients with recurrent CLL and warrants further investigation.",2/10/2013,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'Michael J.

Patients and Methods: Eligible patients with advanced CD117-positive GIST from 56 institutions in 13 countries were randomly assigned to receive either imatinib 400 mg or 800 mg daily. Patients on the 400-mg arm were allowed to cross over to 800 mg upon progression.

Results: Between February 2001 and February 2002, 946 patients were accrued. Median age was 60 years (range, 18 to 91 years). Median follow-up time was 10.9 years. Median progression-free survival times were 1.7 and 2.0 years in the 400- and 800-mg arms, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.91; P = .18), and median overall survival time was 3.9 years in both treatment arms. The estimated 10-year progression-free survival rates were 9.5% and 9.2% for the 400- and 800-mg arms, respectively, and the estimated 10-year overall survival rates were 19.4% and 21.5%, respectively. At multivariable analysis, age (< 60 years), performance status (0 v â‰¥ 1), size of the largest lesion (smaller), and KIT mutation (exon 11) were significant prognostic factors for the probability of surviving beyond 10 years.

Conclusion: This trial was carried out on a worldwide intergroup basis, at the beginning of the learning curve of the use of imatinib, in a large population of patients with advanced GIST. With a long follow-up, 6% of patients are long-term progression free and 13% are survivors. Among clinical prognostic factors, only performance status, KIT mutation, and size of largest lesion predicted long-term outcome, likely pointing to a lower burden of disease. Genomic and/or immune profiling could help understand long-term survivorship. Addressing secondary resistance remains a therapeutic challenge.",5/20/2017,"[{'Author': 'Paolo G.

Methods: In this phase II, open-label trial, patients with predefined BRAF V600Eâ€“mutated malignancies received dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or death. The primary end point was investigator-assessed overall response rate. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety.

Results: Sixteen patients with BRAF V600Eâ€“mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer were evaluable (median follow-up, 47 weeks; range, 4 to 120 weeks). All patients had received prior radiation treatment and/or surgery, and six had received prior systemic therapy. The confirmed overall response rate was 69% (11 of 16; 95% CI, 41% to 89%), with seven ongoing responses. Median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not reached as a result of a lack of events, with 12-month estimates of 90%, 79%, and 80%, respectively. The safety population was composed of 100 patients who were enrolled with seven rare tumor histologies. Common adverse events were fatigue (38%), pyrexia (37%), and nausea (35%). No new safety signals were detected.

Adding a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor may improve outcomes, especially in pMMR disease.

Methods: This phase III, global, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomly assigned eligible patients with newly diagnosed advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer 1:1:1 to: carboplatin/paclitaxel plus durvalumab placebo followed by placebo maintenance (control arm); carboplatin/paclitaxel plus durvalumab followed by maintenance durvalumab plus olaparib placebo (durvalumab arm); or carboplatin/paclitaxel plus durvalumab followed by maintenance durvalumab plus olaparib (durvalumab + olaparib arm). The primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) in the durvalumab arm versus control and the durvalumab + olaparib arm versus control.

Results: Seven hundred eighteen patients were randomly assigned. In the intention-to-treat population, statistically significant PFS benefit was observed in the durvalumab (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.89]; P = .003) and durvalumab + olaparib arms (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.69]; P < .0001) versus control.

Addition of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin to Induction Chemotherapy Improves Survival in Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia,Alan K. Burnett; Nigel H. Russell; Robert K. Hills; Jonathan Kell; Sylvie Freeman; Lars Kjeldsen; Ann E. Hunter; John Yin; Charles F. Craddock; Inge Hoegh Dufva; Keith Wheatley; Donald Milligan,"Purpose: There has been little survival improvement in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the last two decades. Improving induction treatment may improve the rate and quality of remission and consequently survival. In our previous trial, in younger patients, we showed improved survival for the majority of patients when adding gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) to induction chemotherapy.

Patients and Methods: Untreated patients with AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (median age, 67 years; range, 51 to 84 years) were randomly assigned to receive induction chemotherapy with either daunorubicin/ara-C or daunorubicin/clofarabine, with (n = 559) or without (n = 556) GO 3 mg/m2 on day 1 of course one of therapy. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).

Results: The overall response rate was 69% (complete remission [CR], 60%; CR with incomplete recovery [CRi], 9%), with no difference between GO (70%) and no GO (68%) arms. There was no difference in 30- or 60-day mortality and no major increase in toxicity with GO. With median follow-up of 30 months (range, 5.5 to 54.6 months), 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower with GO (68% v 76%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93; P = .007), and 3-year survival was significantly better (25% v 20%; HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.00; P = .05). The benefit was apparent across subgroups. There was no interaction with other treatment interventions. A meta-analysis of 2,228 patients in two United Kingdom National Cancer Research Institute trials showed significant improvements in relapse (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.93; P = .002) and OS (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.98; P = .02).

Conclusion: Adding GO (3 mg/m2) to induction chemotherapy reduces relapse risk and improves survival with little increase in toxicity.",11/10/2012,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'Alan K.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

The phase III PRODIGY study demonstrated that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel, oxaliplatin, and S-1 (DOS) followed by surgery and adjuvant S-1 chemotherapy (CSC) improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with surgery followed by adjuvant S-1 (SC) for patients with resectable locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) with clinical T2-3N+ or T4Nany disease. The primary end point was PFS. Overall survival (OS) was the secondary end point. We herein report the long-term follow-up outcomes, including OS, from this trial. A total of 238 and 246 patients were randomly assigned to the CSC and SC arms, respectively, and were treated (full analysis set). As of the data cutoff (September 2022), the median follow-up duration of the surviving patients was 99.5 months. Compared with SC, CSC significantly increased the OS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; stratified log-rank P = .027) with an 8-year OS rate of 63.0% and 55.1% for the CSC and SC arms, respectively. CSC also significantly improved the PFS (HR, 0.70; stratified log-rank P = .016). In conclusion, neoadjuvant DOS chemotherapy, as part of perioperative chemotherapy, prolonged the OS of Asian patients with LAGC relative to patients treated with surgery and adjuvant S-1.

We report final primary efficacy analysis results for a patient cohort with advanced endometrial carcinoma receiving lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in an ongoing phase Ib/II study of selected solid tumors.

Methods: Patients took lenvatinib 20 mg once daily orally plus pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks, in 3-week cycles. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) at 24 weeks (ORRWk24); secondary efficacy end points included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Tumor assessments were evaluated by investigators per immune-related RECIST.

Results: At data cutoff, 108 patients with previously treated endometrial carcinoma were enrolled, with a median follow-up of 18.7 months. The ORRWk24 was 38.0% (95% CI, 28.8% to 47.8%). Among subgroups, the ORRWk24 (95% CI) was 63.6% (30.8% to 89.1%) in patients with microsatellite instability (MSI)â€“high tumors (n = 11) and 36.2% (26.5% to 46.7%) in patients with microsatellite-stable tumors (n = 94). For previously treated patients, regardless of tumor MSI status, the median DOR was 21.2 months (95% CI, 7.6 months to not estimable), median PFS was 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 8.7 months), and median OS was 16.7 months (15.0 months to not estimable). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 83/124 (66.9%) patients.

Ibrutinib Plus Venetoclax in Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: The CLARITY Study,Peter  Hillmen; Andy C.  Rawstron; Kristian  Brock; Samuel  MuÃ±oz-Vicente; Francesca J.  Yates; Rebecca  Bishop; Rebecca  Boucher; Donald  MacDonald; Christopher  Fegan; Alison  McCaig; Anna  Schuh; Andrew  Pettitt; John G.  Gribben; Piers E.M.  Patten; Stephen  Devereux; Adrian  Bloor; Christopher P.  Fox; Francesco  Forconi; Talha  Munir,"Purpose: The treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been revolutionized by targeted therapies that either inhibit proliferation (ibrutinib) or reactivate apoptosis (venetoclax). Both significantly improve survival in CLL and replace chemoimmunotherapy for many patients. However, individually, they rarely lead to eradication of measurable residual disease (MRD) and usually are taken indefinitely or until progression. We present the CLARITY trial that combined ibrutinib with venetoclax to eradicate detectable CLL with the intention of stopping therapy.

Patients and Methods: CLARITY is a phase II trial that combined ibrutinib with venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The primary end point was eradication of MRD after 12 months of combined therapy. Key secondary end points were response by International Workshop on CLL criteria, safety, and progression-free and overall survival.

Results: In 53 patients after 12 months of ibrutinib plus venetoclax, MRD negativity (fewer than one CLL cell in 10,000 leukocytes) was achieved in the blood of 28 (53%) and the marrow of 19 (36%). Forty-seven patients (89%) responded, and 27 (51%) achieved a complete remission. After a median follow-up of 21.1 months, one patient progressed, and all patients were alive. A single case of biochemical tumor lysis syndrome was observed. Other adverse effects were mild and/or manageable and most commonly were neutropenia or GI events.

Conclusion: The combination of ibrutinib plus venetoclax was well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. There was a high rate of MRD eradication that led to the cessation of therapy in some patients. The progression-free and overall survival rates are encouraging for relapsed and refractory CLL.",10/20/2019,"[{'Author': 'Peter Hillmen', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Janssen Pharmaceuticals, AbbVie, Roche', 'Research Funding: Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Inst), Pharmacyclics (Inst), Roche (Inst), Gilead Sciences (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen Pharmaceuticals, AbbVie']}, {'Author': 'Andy C.

Randomized Phase II Trial of Ridaforolimus in Advanced Endometrial Carcinoma,Amit M. Oza; Sandro Pignata; Andres Poveda; Mary McCormack; Andrew Clamp; Benjamin Schwartz; Jonathan Cheng; Xiaoyun Li; Kristy Campbell; Pierre Dodion; Frank G. Haluska,"Purpose: The prognosis for women with recurrent and metastatic endometrial cancer is poor, and improved therapies are needed. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is an important target, and mTOR inhibitors show clinical activity in endometrial cancer.

Patients and Methods: An open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase II trial of oral ridaforolimus compared with progestin or investigator choice chemotherapy (comparator) was undertaken in women with metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer who had progressive disease following one or two lines of chemotherapy and no hormonal therapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by independent radiologic review.

Results: One hundred thirty patients were enrolled (64 received ridaforolimus and 66 received the comparator), and median age was 66 years. Treatment discontinuation as a result of adverse events was 33% with ridaforolimus versus 6% with the comparator, with common (> 10%) grade 3 toxicities being hyperglycemia, anemia, and diarrhea. Thirty-eight percent (ridaforolimus) versus 71% (comparator) of patients discontinued treatment as a result of disease progression. Median PFS at the protocol prespecified interim analysis with 58 PFS events (primary end point) was 3.6 months (95% CI, 2.7 to 7.3 months) for ridaforolimus and 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.3 months) for the comparator (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.90; P = .008). PFS rate for ridaforolimus versus comparator was 48% versus 18% at 16 weeks and 38% versus 15% at 24 weeks. Objective response rate for ridaforolimus versus comparator was 0% versus 4% (P = .925), and stable disease was achieved in 35% versus 17% of patients (P = .021).

Conclusion: Oral ridaforolimus shows encouraging activity in advanced endometrial cancer but is associated with significant toxicity.

CONTACT-01 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04471428) evaluated atezolizumab plus cabozantinib versus docetaxel in patients with metastatic NSCLC who developed disease progression after concurrent or sequential treatment with antiâ€“PD-L1/PD-1 and platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Methods: This multicenter, open-label, phase III trial randomly assigned patients 1:1 to atezolizumab 1,200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks (q3w) plus cabozantinib 40 mg orally once daily or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously once every 3 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).

Results: One hundred eighty-six patients were assigned atezolizumab plus cabozantinib, and 180 docetaxel. Minimum OS follow-up was 10.9 months. Median OS was 10.7 months (95% CI, 8.8 to 12.3) with atezolizumab plus cabozantinib and 10.5 months (95% CI, 8.6 to 13.0) with docetaxel (stratified hazard ratio [HR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.16]; P = .3668). Median progression-free survival was 4.6 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 5.6) and 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.1 to 4.4), respectively (stratified HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.92]). Serious adverse events (AEs) occurred in 71 (38.4%) patients receiving atezolizumab plus cabozantinib and 58 (34.7%) receiving docetaxel. Grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 73 (39.5%) patients receiving atezolizumab plus cabozantinib and 58 (34.7%) receiving docetaxel. Grade 5 AEs occurred in 14 (7.6%) and 10 (6.0%) patients in the atezolizumab plus cabozantinib and docetaxel arms, respectively (treatment-related in four [2.2%] and one [0.6%], respectively).

Conclusion: Atezolizumab plus cabozantinib after disease progression following antiâ€“PD-L1/PD-1 immunotherapy and platinum-containing chemotherapy for metastatic NSCLC did not improve OS compared with docetaxel. Safety was consistent with known profiles of these agents.",7/10/2024,"[{'Author': 'Joel Neal', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: CME Matters, Clinical Care Options, Research to Practice, Medscape, Biomedical Learning Institute, Peerview, Prime Oncology, Projects in Knowledge, Rockpointe CME, MJH Life Sciences, Medical Educator Consortium, HMP Education', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Genentech/Roche, Exelixis, Takeda, Lilly, Amgen, Iovance Biotherapeutics, Blueprint Medicines, Regeneron, Natera, Sanofi/Regeneron, D2G Oncology, Surface Oncology, Turning Point Therapeutics, Mirati Therapeutics, Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, Summit Therapeutics, Novartis, Novocure', 'Research Funding: Genentech/Roche (Inst), Merck (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Boehringer Ingelheim (Inst), Exelixis (Inst), Nektar (Inst), Takeda (Inst), Adaptimmune (Inst), GlaxoSmithKline (Inst), Janssen (Inst), AbbVie (Inst), Novocure (Inst)', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: UpToDateâ€”Royalties']}, {'Author': 'Nick Pavlakis', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: BeiGene, Bayer, BeiGene, Takeda, Pierre Fabre', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZeneca, Merck KGaA, Merck Serono, Amgen, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis, Pfizer, Takeda, Bristol Myers Squibb, BeiGene, Gilead Sciences, Janssen Oncology', 'Research Funding: Bayer (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Roche (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Yasushi Goto', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lilly Japan, Chugai Pharma, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Ono Pharmaceutical, MSD, Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb Japan, Novartis, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Merck, Guardant Health AMEA, Takeda, Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo/UCB Japan, Amgen, Janssen, Sandoz, Nichi-Iko, Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Lilly, Boehringer Ingelheim, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Chugai Pharma, Guardant Health AMEA, Daiichi Sankyo/UCB Japan, Janssen, Ono Pharmaceutical', 'Research Funding: AbbVie (Inst), Lilly Japan (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Ono Pharmaceutical (Inst), Daiichi Sankyo (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb Japan (Inst), Chugai Pharma (Inst), Taiho Pharmaceutical (Inst), MSD (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Merck Serono (Inst), Genomic Health (Inst), CMIC (Inst), Takeda (Inst), EPS Holdings (Inst), IQVIA (Inst), Daiichi Sankyo/UCB Japan (Inst), Janssen (Inst), Amgen (Inst), EP Croit Co (Inst), Amgen Astellas BioPharma (Inst), Bayer (Inst), Preferred Network (Inst), Medpace (Inst), Sysmex (Inst)', 'Uncompensated Relationships: Cancer Net Japan, JAMT']}, {'Author': 'Sun Min Lim', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Takeda, Boehringer Ingelheim, Yuhan', 'Research Funding: Janssen Research & Development']}, {'Author': 'Giannis Mountzios', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZeneca, MSD, BMS GmbH & Co KG, Novartis, Amgen, Takeda', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, AstraZeneca/Greece, MSD, Amgen, Novartis, BMS GmbH & Co KG, Takeda', ""Speakers' Bureau: AstraZeneca"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: AstraZeneca, Ipsen, MSD, Roche, Novartis, BMS GmbH & Co KG, Demo Pharmaceutical']}, {'Author': 'Elena Fountzilas', 'Disclosures': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Deciphera, Genprex', 'Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Roche, Amgen, Roche/Genentech, Pfizer, AstraZeneca', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Pfizer, Sanofi, Roche, Amgen', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Genesis Pharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca, Pfizer']}, {'Author': 'Daniel C.

Methods: We randomly assigned treatment-naÃ¯ve, advanced-stage, high-tumor burden follicular lymphoma patients to receive standard RM or a response-adapted postinduction approach on the basis of metabolic response and molecular assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD). The experimental arm used three types of postinduction therapies: for complete metabolic response (CMR) and MRD-negative patients, observation; for CMR and MRD-positive (end of induction or follow-up) patients, four doses of rituximab (one per week, maximum three courses) until MRD-negative; and for non-CMR patients, one dose of ibritumomab tiuxetan followed by standard RM. The study was designed as noninferiority trial with progression-free survival (PFS) as the primary end point.

Results: Overall, 807 patients were randomly assigned. After a median follow-up of 53 months (range, 1-92 months), patients in the standard arm had a significantly better PFS than those in the experimental arm (3-year PFS 86% v 72%; P < .001). The better PFS of the standard versus experimental arm was confirmed in all the study subgroups except non-CMR patients (n = 65; P = .274). The 3-year overall survival was 98% (95% CI, 96 to 99) and 97% (95% CI, 95 to 99) in the reference and experimental arms, respectively (P = .238).

Conclusion: A metabolic and molecular response-adapted therapy as assessed in the FOLL12 study was associated with significantly inferior PFS compared with 2-year RM.

Relapsed or refractory AML (R/R-AML) remains a particularly adverse population necessitating improved therapeutic options. This phase Ib/II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and idarubicin combined with the B-cell lymphoma-2 inhibitor venetoclax in ND-AML and R/R-AML.

Materials and Methods: The phase IB portion (PIB) enrolled patients with R/R-AML using a 3 + 3 dose escalation and de-escalation algorithm for identification of maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities. The phase II portion enrolled patients into two arms to evaluate response and time-to-event end points: phase IIA (PIIA): ND-AML and phase IIB (PIIB): R/R-AML.

Results: Sixty-eight patients have enrolled to date (PIB, 16; PIIA, 29; PIIB, 23). Median age was 46 years (range, 20-73). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurring in â‰¥ 10% of patients included febrile neutropenia (50%), bacteremia (35%), pneumonia (28%), and sepsis (12%). The overall response rate for PIB, PIIA, and PIIB was 75%, 97%, and 70% with 75%, 90%, and 61%, respectively, achieving a composite CR. Measurable residual diseaseâ€“negative composite CR was attained in 96% of ND-AML and 69% of R/R-AML patients. After a median follow-up of 12 months, median overall survival (OS) for both PII cohorts was not reached. Fifty-six percent of patients proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (ND-AML, 69%; R/R-AML, 46%). In R/R-AML, allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation resulted in a significant improvement in OS (median OS, NR; 1-year OS, 87%). One-year survival post-HSCT was 94% in ND-AML and 78% in R/R-AML.

Conclusion: Fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and idarubicin + venetoclax represents an effective intensive treatment regimen in ND-AML and R/R-AML patients, associated with deep remissions and a high rate of transition to successful transplantation.",9/1/2021,"[{'Author': 'Courtney D.

Tolaney; on behalf of the Consortium of the TBCRC Translational Investigators,"Purpose: Long-term outcomes of patients with stage I human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)â€“positive breast cancer receiving adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) remain undefined, and prognostic predictors represent an unmet need.

Methods: In the ATEMPT phase II trial, patients with stage I centrally confirmed HER2-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned 3:1 to adjuvant T-DM1 for 1 year or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (TH). Coprimary objectives were to compare the incidence of clinically relevant toxicities between arms and to evaluate invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) with T-DM1. Correlative analyses included the HER2DX genomic tool, multiomic evaluations of HER2 heterogeneity, and predictors of thrombocytopenia.

Results: After a median follow-up of 5.8 years, 11 iDFS events were observed in the T-DM1 arm, consistent with a 5-year iDFS of 97.0% (95% CI, 95.2 to 98.7). At 5 years, the recurrence-free interval (RFI) was 98.3% (95% CI, 97.0 to 99.7), the overall survival was 97.8% (95% CI, 96.3 to 99.3), and the breast cancer-specific survival was 99.4% (95% CI, 98.6 to 100). Comparable iDFS was observed with T-DM1 irrespective of tumor size, hormone receptor status, centrally determined HER2 immunohistochemical score, and receipt of T-DM1 for more or less than 6 months. Although ATEMPT was not powered for this end point, the 5-year iDFS in the TH arm was 91.1%. Among patients with sufficient tissue for HER2DX testing (n = 187), 5-year outcomes significantly differed according to HER2DX risk score, with better RFI (98.1% v 81.8%, hazard ratio [HR], 0.10, P = .01) and iDFS (96.3% v 81.8%, HR, 0.20, P = .047) among patients with HER2DX low-risk versus high-risk tumors, respectively.

Conclusion: Adjuvant T-DM1 for 1 year leads to outstanding long-term outcomes for patients with stage I HER2-positive breast cancer.

Hypofractionated Versus Standard Fractionated Radiotherapy in Patients With Early Breast Cancer or Ductal Carcinoma In Situ in a Randomized Phase III Trial: The DBCG HYPO Trial,Birgitte V.  Offersen; Jan  Alsner; Hanne M.  Nielsen; Erik H.  Jakobsen; Mette H.  Nielsen; Mechthild  Krause; Lars  Stenbygaard; Ingvil  Mjaaland; Andreas  Schreiber; Unn-Miriam  Kasti; Jens  Overgaard; on behalf of the Danish Breast Cancer Group Radiation Therapy Committee,"Purpose: Given the poor results using hypofractionated radiotherapy for early breast cancer, a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions (fr) has been the standard regimen used by the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) since 1982. Results from more recent trials have stimulated a renewed interest in hypofractionation, and the noninferiority DBCG HYPO trial (ClincalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00909818) was designed to determine whether a dose of 40 Gy in 15 fr does not increase the occurrence of breast induration at 3 years compared with a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fr.

Patients and Methods: One thousand eight hundred eighty-two patients > 40 years of age who underwent breast-conserving surgery for node-negative breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were randomly assigned to radiotherapy at a dose of either 50 Gy in 25 fr or 40 Gy in 15 fr. The primary end point was 3-year grade 2-3 breast induration assuming noninferiority regarding locoregional recurrence.

Results: A total of 1,854 consenting patients (50 Gy, n = 937; 40 Gy, n = 917) were enrolled from 2009-2014 from eight centers. There were 1,608 patients with adenocarcinoma and 246 patients with DCIS. The 3-year rates of induration were 11.8% (95% CI, 9.7% to 14.1%) in the 50-Gy group and 9.0% (95% CI, 7.2% to 11.1%) in the 40-Gy group (risk difference, âˆ’2.7%; 95% CI, âˆ’5.6% to 0.2%; P = .07). Systemic therapies and radiotherapy boost did not increase the risk of induration. Telangiectasia, dyspigmentation, scar appearance, edema, and pain were detected at low rates, and cosmetic outcome and patient satisfaction with breast appearance were high with either no difference or better outcome in the 40-Gy cohort compared with the 50-Gy cohort. The 9-year risk of locoregional recurrence was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.0% to 5.0%) in the 50-Gy group and 3.0% (95% CI, 1.9% to 4.5%) in the 40-Gy group (risk difference, âˆ’0.3%; 95% CI, âˆ’2.3% to 1.7%). The 9-year overall survival was 93.4% (95% CI, 91.1% to 95.1%) in the 50-Gy group and 93.4% (95% CI, 91.0% to 95.2%) in the 40-Gy group. The occurrence of radiation-associated cardiac and lung disease was rare and not influenced by the fractionation regimen.

Conclusion: Moderately hypofractionated breast irradiation of node-negative breast cancer or DCIS did not result in more breast induration compared with standard fractionated therapy. Other normal tissue effects were minimal, with similar or less frequent rates in the 40-Gy group. The 9-year locoregional recurrence risk was low.",11/1/2020,"[{'Author': 'Erik H.

Kaufman,"Purpose: We evaluated the activity of intratumoral Coxsackievirus A21 (V937) in 57 patients with unresectable stage IIIC or IV melanoma.

Patients and Methods: In this multicenter, open-label, phase II study, patients received up to a total V937 dose of 3 Ã— 108 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) in a maximum 4.0-mL volume by intratumoral injection. Ten sets of V937 injections were administered between days 1 and 127 (NCT01227551). Patients who had stable disease or were responding could continue treatment in an extension study (NCT01636882). Response and progression status were based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or caliper measurement and were categorized using immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST). Other evaluations included monitoring of adverse events and serum levels of V937 and anti-V937 antibody titers. The primary efficacy end point was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate per irRECIST.

Results: The primary efficacy end point, 6-month PFS rate per irRECIST, was 38.6% (95% CI, 26.0 to 52.4). Durable response rate (partial or complete response for â‰¥ 6 months) was 21.1% per irRECIST. Best overall response rate (complete plus partial response) was 38.6% (unconfirmed) and 28.1% (confirmed) per irRECIST. Regression of melanoma was observed in noninjected lesions. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimation, 12-month PFS was 32.9% (95% CI, 19.5 to 46.9) per irRECIST and 12-month overall survival was 75.4% (95% CI, 62.1 to 84.7). No treatment-related grade â‰¥ 3 adverse events occurred. Viral RNA was detected in serum within 30 minutes of administration. Neutralizing antibody titers increased to > 1:16 in all patients after day 22, without effect on clinical or immunologic response.

Conclusion: V937 was well tolerated and warrants further investigation for treatment of patients with unresectable melanoma.

Rowe; Elena Tothova; Carmino De Souza; Marc Rudoltz; Richard Yu; Tillmann Krahnke; Hagop M. Kantarjian; Jerald P. Radich; Timothy P. Hughes,"Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of initial treatment with imatinib mesylate 800 mg/d (400 mg twice daily) versus 400 mg/d in patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase.

Patients and Methods: A total of 476 patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to imatinib 800 mg (n = 319) or 400 mg (n = 157) daily. The primary end point was the major molecular response (MMR) rate at 12 months.

Results: At 12 months, differences in MMR and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rates were not statistically significant (MMR, 46% v 40%; P = .2035; CCyR, 70% v 66%; P = .3470). However, MMR occurred faster among patients randomly assigned to imatinib 800 mg/d, who had higher rates of MMR at 3 and 6 months compared with those in the imatinib 400-mg/d arm (P = .0035 by log-rank test). CCyR also occurred faster in the 800-mg/d arm (CCyR at 6 months, 57% v 45%; P = .0146). The most common adverse events were edema, gastrointestinal problems, and rash, and all were more common in patients in the 800-mg/d arm. Grades 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity also occurred more frequently in patients receiving imatinib 800 mg/d.

Conclusion: MMR rates at 1 year were similar with imatinib 800 mg/d and 400 mg/d, but MMR and CCyR occurred earlier in patients treated with 800 mg/d.

"Phase II Study of Modified Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and Fluorouracil With Bevacizumab in Patients With Metastatic Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma",Manish A. Shah; Minaxi Jhawer; David H. Ilson; Robert A. Lefkowitz; Edric Robinson; Marinela Capanu; David P. Kelsen,"Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a modified administration schedule of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (mDCF) with bevacizumab in patients with advanced gastroesophageal malignancies.

Patients and Methods: Previously untreated patients with metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma received bevacizumab 10 mg/kg, docetaxel 40 mg/m2, fluorouracil 400 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2 on day 1, fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m2/d Ã— 2 days intravenous continuous infusion beginning on day 1, and cisplatin 40 mg/m2 on day 3. The primary objective was to improve 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) from 43% (historical DCF control) to 63% with the addition of bevacizumab. The target accrual was 44 patients to have 10% type I and II error rates.

Results: In total, 44 eligible patients with cancer were enrolled from October 2006 to October 2008: 22 gastric, 20 gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), and two esophagus. In 39 patients with measurable disease, the confirmed response rate was 67% (95% CI, 50% to 81%). Six-month PFS was 79% (95% CI, 63% to 88%), and median PFS was 12 months (95% CI, 8.8 to 18.2 months). With 26-month follow-up, median overall survival (OS) was 16.8 months (95% CI, 12.1 to 26.1 months), and 2-year survival was 37%. Treatment-related grade 3 to 4 toxicity was as follows: neutropenia without fever (50%), fatigue (25%), venous thromboembolism (39%), and nausea, vomiting, mucositis, neuropathy, and febrile neutropenia less than 10% each. In subset analysis, diffuse gastric cancer had significantly worse PFS and OS, and the response rate in proximal/GEJ tumors was 85% (95% CI, 62% to 97%).

Conclusion: mDCF with bevacizumab appears tolerable and has notable patient outcomes in patients with advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Six-month PFS was 79%, surpassing our predefined efficacy end point, and median and 2-year OS were 16.8 months and 37%, respectively.",3/1/2011,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Stock Ownership:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria:']}, {'Author': 'Manish A.

Winer,"Purpose: In the HER2CLIMB study, patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)â€“positive breast cancer with brain metastases (BMs) showed statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with tucatinib. We describe exploratory analyses of intracranial efficacy and survival in participants with BMs.

Patients and Methods: Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to tucatinib or placebo, in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine. All patients underwent baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging; those with BMs were classified as active or stable. Efficacy analyses were performed by applying RECIST 1.1 criteria to CNS target lesions by investigator assessment. CNS-PFS (intracranial progression or death) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated in all patients with BMs. Confirmed intracranial objective response rate (ORR-IC) was evaluated in patients with measurable intracranial disease.

Results: There were 291 patients with BMs: 198 (48%) in the tucatinib arm and 93 (46%) in the control arm. The risk of intracranial progression or death was reduced by 68% in the tucatinib arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.48; P < .0001). Median CNS-PFS was 9.9 months in the tucatinib arm versus 4.2 months in the control arm. Risk of death was reduced by 42% in the tucatinib arm (OS HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.85; P = .005). Median OS was 18.1 versus 12.0 months. ORR-IC was higher in the tucatinib arm (47.3%; 95% CI, 33.7% to 61.2%) versus the control arm (20.0%; 95% CI, 5.7% to 43.7%; P = .03).

Conclusion: In patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with BMs, the addition of tucatinib to trastuzumab and capecitabine doubled ORR-IC, reduced risk of intracranial progression or death by two thirds, and reduced risk of death by nearly half. To our knowledge, this is the first regimen to demonstrate improved antitumor activity against BMs in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer in a randomized, controlled trial.",8/10/2020,"[{'Author': 'Nancy U.

Phase II Selection Design Trial of Concurrent Chemotherapy and Cetuximab Versus Chemotherapy Followed by Cetuximab in Advanced-Stage Nonâ€“Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Southwest Oncology Group Study S0342,Roy S. Herbst; Karen Kelly; Kari Chansky; Philip C. Mack; Wilbur A. Franklin; Fred R. Hirsch; James N. Atkins; Shaker R. Dakhil; Kathy S. Albain; Edward S. Kim; Mary Redman; John J. Crowley; David R. Gandara,"Purpose: Randomized clinical trials failed to show a survival benefit for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors plus concurrent chemotherapy in patients with metastatic nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with preclinical data suggesting potential negative interactions. In contrast, pilot trials of the EGFR-targeted antibody, cetuximab, plus chemotherapy suggested enhanced antitumor activity. This randomized phase II trial was designed to select a cetuximab plus chemotherapy regimen for phase III evaluation.

Patients and Methods: Treatment-naive patients with advanced-stage NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel (225 mg/m2) and carboplatin (area under the curve, 6) every 3 weeks plus concurrent cetuximab (400 mg/m2 loading dose followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly) for four cycles followed by maintenance cetuximab or sequential paclitaxel-carboplatin for four cycles followed by cetuximab.

Results: Of 242 patients enrolled, 224 were eligible and assessable for response (106 and 118 patients in the concurrent and sequential arms, respectively). With a median follow-up time of 32 months, the median overall survival was 10.9 months (95% CI, 9.2 to 13.0 months) for patients receiving concurrent therapy and 10.7 months (95% CI, 8.5 to 12.8 months) for patients receiving sequential therapy (P = .57); 1-year survival rates were 45% (95% CI, 36% to 54%) and 44% (95% CI, 35% to 53%), respectively. Response rates and progression-free survival times were similar in both arms, as was grade 3 rash, whereas sensory neuropathy was higher in the concurrent arm (15% v 5% in the sequential arm; P = .036).

Conclusion: Although both regimens met the efficacy criterion for continued evaluation, the concurrent regimen of paclitaxel/carboplatin plus cetuximab was chosen.",11/1/2010,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'Roy S.

Prolonged Administration of Azacitidine With or Without Entinostat for Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Myelodysplasia-Related Changes: Results of the US Leukemia Intergroup Trial E1905,Thomas Prebet; Zhuoxin Sun; Maria E.

Smith; Lisa Malick; Elisabeth Paietta; Magdalena Czader; Mark Litzow; Janice Gabrilove; Harry P. Erba; Steven D. Gore; Martin S. Tallman,"Purpose: Although azacitidine (AZA) improves survival in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, the overall response remains approximately 50%. Entinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has been combined with AZA with significant clinical activity in a previous phase I dose finding study.

Design: Open label phase II randomized trial comparing AZA 50 mg/m2/d given for 10 days Â± entinostat 4 mg/m2/d day 3 and day 10. All subtypes of myelodysplasia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes were eligible for the study. The primary objective was the rate of hematologic normalization (HN; complete remission + partial remission + trilineage hematological improvement).

Results: One hundred forty-nine patients were analyzed, including 97 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and 52 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. In the AZA group, 32% (95% CI, 22% to 44%) experienced HN and 27% (95% CI, 17% to 39%) in the AZA + entinostat group. Both arms exceeded the HN rate of historical control (Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9221 trial), but only the AZA group fulfilled the primary objective of the study. Rates of overall hematologic response were 46% and 44%, respectively. Median overall survivals were 18 months for the AZA group and 13 months for the AZA + entinostat group. The combination arm led to less demethylation compared with the monotherapy arm, suggesting pharmacodynamic antagonism.

Conclusion: Addition of entinostat to AZA did not increase clinical response as defined by the protocol and was associated with pharmacodynamic antagonism. However, the prolonged administration of AZA by itself seems to increase HN rate compared with standard dosing and warrants additional investigation.",4/20/2014,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'Ari Melnick', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role: Celgene']}, {'Author': 'Harry P.

To reduce this uncertainty, we conducted a randomized trial to test whether an intensive (INT) versus a minimalist (MIN) follow-up regimen improves overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing operation for endometrial cancer.

Methods: The TOTEM study was a large, pragmatic randomized trial, conducted in 42 hospitals (in Italy and France) including patients surgically treated for endometrial cancer, in complete clinical remission, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I-IV. After stratification by center and risk of relapse (low or high), patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to INT or MIN hospital-based follow-up regimens. The study was powered to demonstrate an absolute improvement of 5% of the 5-year OS with the INT regimen.

Results: In total, 1,871 patients were randomly assigned between November 2008 and July 2018, and 1,847 patients (98.7%) were available for the final analysis (60% low risk). After a median follow-up of 69 months, the 5-year OS was 90.6% in the INT and 91.9% in the MIN arms (hazard ratio, 1.13, 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.50, P = .380). No differences in OS were found in subgroup analyses considering age, cancer treatment, risk of relapse, and degree of adherence of the center to the scheduled follow-up. The probability of detecting a relapse was slightly higher in the INT arm (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.48; P = .194).

Conclusion: An INT follow-up in endometrial cancerâ€“treated patients does not improve OS, even in high-risk patients.

Federico,"Purpose: We evaluated whether combining a humanized antidisialoganglioside monoclonal antibody (hu14.18K322A) throughout therapy improves early response and outcomes in children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma.

Patients and Methods: We conducted a prospective, single-arm, three-stage, phase II clinical trial. Six cycles of induction chemotherapy were coadministered with hu14.18K322A, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2). The consolidation regimen included busulfan and melphalan. When available, an additional cycle of parent-derived natural killer cells with hu14.18K322A was administered during consolidation (n = 31). Radiation therapy was administered at the end of consolidation. Postconsolidation treatment included hu14.18K322A, GM-CSF, IL-2, and isotretinoin. Early response was assessed after the first two cycles of induction therapy. End-of-induction response, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.

Results: Sixty-four patients received hu14.18K322A with induction chemotherapy. This regimen was well tolerated, with continuous infusion narcotics. Partial responses (PRs) or better after the first two chemoimmunotherapy cycles occurred in 42 of 63 evaluable patients (66.7%; 95% CI, 55.0 to 78.3). Primary tumor volume decreased by a median of 75% (range, 100% [complete disappearance]-5% growth). Median peak hu14.18K322A serum levels in cycle one correlated with early response to therapy (P = .0154, one-sided t-test). Sixty of 62 patients (97%) had an end-of-induction partial response or better. No patients experienced progressive disease during induction. The 3-year EFS was 73.7% (95% CI, 60.0 to 83.4), and the OS was 86.0% (95% CI, 73.8 to 92.8), respectively.

Conclusion: Adding hu14.18K322A to induction chemotherapy improved early objective responses, significantly reduced tumor volumes in most patients, improved end-of-induction response rates, and yielded an encouraging 3-year EFS. These results, if validated in a larger study, may be practice changing.",2/1/2022,"[{'Author': 'Barry L.

Molecular Alterations and Everolimus Efficacy in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2â€“Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancers: Combined Exploratory Biomarker Analysis From BOLERO-1 and BOLERO-3,Fabrice AndrÃ©; Sara Hurvitz; Angelica Fasolo; Ling-Ming Tseng; Guy Jerusalem; Sharon Wilks; Ruth Oâ€™Regan; Claudine Isaacs; Masakazu Toi; Howard A. Burris; Wei He; Douglas Robinson; Markus Riester; Tetiana Taran; David Chen; Dennis Slamon,"Purpose: Two recent phase III trials, BOLERO-1 and BOLERO-3 (Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus), evaluated the addition of everolimus to trastuzumab and chemotherapy in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2â€“overexpressing advanced breast cancer. The current analysis aimed to identify biomarkers to predict the clinical efficacy of everolimus treatment.

Methods: Archival tumor samples from patients in BOLERO-1 and BOLERO-3 were analyzed using next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and Sanger sequencing.

Results: Biomarker data were available for 549 patients. PIK3CA activating mutations and PTEN loss were reported in 30% and 16% of BOLERO-1 samples and in 32% and 12% of BOLERO-3 samples, respectively. PI3K pathway was hyperactive (PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss and/or AKT1 mutation) in 47% of BOLERO-1 and 41% of BOLERO-3 samples. In both studies, differential progression-free survival (PFS) benefits of everolimus were consistently observed in patient subgroups defined by their PI3K pathway status. When analyzing combined data sets of both studies, everolimus was associated with a decreased hazard of progression in patients with PIK3CA mutations (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.00), PTEN loss (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.96), or hyperactive PI3K pathway (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.93). Patients with wild-type PIK3CA (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.46), normal PTEN (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.26), or normal PI3K pathway activity (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.62) did not derive PFS benefit from everolimus.

Conclusion: This analysis, although exploratory, suggests that patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2â€“positive advanced breast cancer having tumors with PIK3CA mutations, PTEN loss, or hyperactive PI3K pathway could derive PFS benefit from everolimus.",6/20/2016,"[{'Author': 'Fabrice AndrÃ©', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: AstraZeneca (Inst), Eisai (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Eli Lilly (Inst), Servier (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: AstraZeneca, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline']}, {'Author': 'Sara Hurvitz', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Genentech (Inst), Novartis (Inst), GlaxoSmithKline (Inst), Boehringer Ingelheim (Inst), Sanofi (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Amgen (Inst), OBI Pharma (Inst), Puma Biotechnology (Inst), Dignitana (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis, Genentech, Eli Lilly, Pfizer']}, {'Author': 'Angelica Fasolo', 'Disclosures': ['No relationship to disclose']}, {'Author': 'Ling-Ming Tseng', 'Disclosures': ['No relationship to disclose']}, {'Author': 'Guy Jerusalem', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Novartis, Celgene, Roche', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, Celgene, Pfizer', 'Research Funding: Novartis, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Roche', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Novartis, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline']}, {'Author': 'Sharon Wilks', 'Disclosures': ['Speakersâ€™ Bureau: Genentech, Novartis, Pfizer']}, {'Author': 'Ruth Oâ€™Regan', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Novartis, Roche, Genomic Health, Genentech, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Eisai, Puma Biotechnology', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Genentech, Eli Lilly, Puma Biotechnology, Eisai', 'Research Funding: Novartis (Inst), Genentech (Inst), Eisai (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche, Genomic Health, Novartis, Celgene, Genentech, Eli Lilly']}, {'Author': 'Claudine Isaacs', 'Disclosures': ['No relationship to disclose']}, {'Author': 'Masakazu Toi', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Chugai Pharmaceutical (Inst), Taiho Pharmaceutical (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Howard A.

Cheung; Neeta  Pandit-Taskar,"Purpose: Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), a rare sarcoma of adolescents/young adults primarily involving the peritoneum, has a long-term survival of < 20% despite aggressive multimodality treatment. B7H3 is expressed on DSRCT cell surface, providing a target for antibody-based immunotherapy.

Patients and Methods: In this phase I study, we evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution of intraperitoneal (IP) radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with the anti-B7H3 murine monoclonal antibody 131I-omburtamab in patients with DSRCT or other B7H3-expressing tumors involving the peritoneum. After thyroid blockade, patients received 131I-omburtamab as a single IP injection at escalated activities from 1.11 to 3.33/GBq/m2. A prior tracer dose of IP 74 MBq124I-omburtamab was used for radioimmunoâ€“positron emission tomography imaging. Each injection was followed by IP saline infusion.

Results: Fifty-two patients (48, three, and one with DSRCT, peritoneal rhabdomyosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma, respectively) received IP 131I-omburtamab administered on an outpatient basis. Maximum tolerated dose was not reached; there were no dose-limiting toxicities. Major related adverse events were transient: grade 4 neutropenia (n = 2 patients) and thrombocytopenia (n = 1), and grade 1 (10%) and grade 2 (52%) pain lasting < 2 hours related to saline infusion. Hypothyroidism was not observed, and antidrug antibody was elicited in 5%. Mean (Â± SD) projected peritoneal residence time was 22.4 Â± 7.9 hours. Mean projected absorbed doses for 131I-omburtamab based on 124I-omburtamab dosimetry to normal organs were low and well within tolerable limits. More than 80% 131I remained protein bound in blood 66 hours after RIT. On the basis of peritoneal dose and feasibility for outpatient administration, the recommended phase II activity was established at 2.96 GBq/m2. Patients with DSRCT receiving standard whole-abdominal radiotherapy after RIT did not experience unexpected toxicity.

Conclusion: IP RIT 131I-omburtamab was well tolerated with minimal toxicities. Radiation exposure to normal organs was low, making combination therapy with other anticancer therapies feasible.",12/20/2020,"[{'Author': 'Shakeel Modak', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Y-mAbs Therapeutics, Illumina RP', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Two patents pending, no financial benefit']}, {'Author': 'Pat Zanzonico', 'Disclosures': ['Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Y-mAbs']}, {'Author': 'Emily K.

Immunosuppressive Therapy for Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome: A Prospective Randomized Multicenter Phase III Trial Comparing Antithymocyte Globulin Plus Cyclosporine With Best Supportive CareÃ¢â‚¬â€SAKK 33/99,Jakob R. Passweg; Aristoteles A.N. Giagounidis; Mathew Simcock; Carlo Aul; Christiane Dobbelstein; Michael Stadler; Gert Ossenkoppele; Wolf-Karsten Hofmann; Kristina Schilling; AndrÃƒÂ© Tichelli; Arnold Ganser,"Purpose: Immunosuppressive treatment is reported to improve cytopenia in some patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Combined antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine (CSA) is most effective in patients with immune-mediated marrow failure.

Patients and Methods: This trial was designed to assess the impact of immunosuppression on hematopoiesis, transfusion requirements, transformation, and survival in patients with MDS randomly assigned to 15 mg/kg of horse ATG for 5 days and oral CSA for 180 days (ATG+CSA) or best supportive care (BSC), stratified by treatment center and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk score. Primary end point was best hematologic response at 6 months. Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of Ã¢â€°Â¤ 2 and transfusion dependency of less than 2 years in duration.

Results: Between 2000 and 2006, 45 patients received ATG+CSA (median age, 62 years; range, 23 to 75 years; 56% men) and 43 patients received BSC (median age, 65 years; range, 24 to 76 years; 81% men). IPSS score was low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, high, and not evaluable in eight, 24, seven, one, and five patients on ATG+CSA, respectively, and eight, 25, five, zero, and five patients on BSC, respectively. Refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) -I, RAEB-II, and hypoplastic disease were present in 21, six, nine, zero, and nine patients on ATG+CSA, respectively, and 18, eight, 11, two, and four patients on BSC, respectively. By month 6, 13 of 45 patients on ATG+CSA had a hematologic response compared with four of 43 patients on BSC (P = .0156). Two-year transformation-free survival (TFS) rates were 46% (95% CI, 28% to 62%) and 55% (95% CI, 34% to 70%) for ATG+CSA and BSC patients, respectively (P = .730), whereas overall survival (OS) estimates were 49% (95% CI, 31% to 66%) and 63% (95% CI, 42% to 78%), respectively (P = .828).

Dimopoulos,"Purpose: The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III iNNOVATE study showed sustained efficacy of ibrutinib-rituximab in WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia (WM). Here, we present the final analysis from iNNOVATE.

Methods: Patients had confirmed symptomatic WM, either previously untreated or previously treated; patients with prior rituximab had at least a minor response to their last rituximab-based regimen. Patients were randomly assigned to once-daily ibrutinib 420 mg plus rituximab or placebo plus rituximab (n = 75 per arm). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included response rate, time to next treatment, hemoglobin improvement, overall survival, and safety.

Results: With a median follow-up of 50 (range, 0.5-63) months, median (95% CI) PFS was not reached (57.7 months to not evaluable) with ibrutinib-rituximab versus 20.3 months (13.0 to 27.6) with placebo-rituximab (hazard ratio, 0.250; P < .0001). PFS benefit was regardless of prior treatment status, MYD88 and CXCR4 mutation status, or key patient characteristics. Higher response rates (partial response or better) were observed with ibrutinib-rituximab (76% v 31% with placebo-rituximab; P < .0001) and were sustained over time. Median time to next treatment was not reached with ibrutinib-rituximab versus 18 months with placebo-rituximab. More patients receiving ibrutinib-rituximab versus placebo-rituximab had sustained hemoglobin improvement (77% v 43%; P < .0001). Median overall survival was not reached in either arm. Ibrutinib-rituximab maintained a manageable safety profile; the prevalence of grade â‰¥ 3 adverse events of clinical interest generally decreased over time.

Conclusion: In the final analysis of iNNOVATE with a median follow-up of 50 months, ibrutinib-rituximab showed ongoing superiority across clinical outcomes in patients with WM regardless of MYD88 or CXCR4 mutation status, prior treatment, and key patient characteristics.",1/1/2022,"[{'Author': 'Christian Buske', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche/Genentech, Janssen, BeiGene, Novartis, Pfizer, Incyte, AbbVie, Gilead Sciences, Celltrion, MorphoSys, Regeneron', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Gilead Sciences, Janssen, Roche, Pfizer, BeiGene, Celltrion, AbbVie, Incyte, Regeneron, MorphoSys, Novartis', ""Speakers' Bureau: Roche, Janssen, BeiGene, Celltrion, AbbVie, Pfizer, Gilead Sciences"", 'Research Funding: Roche/Genentech, Janssen, Celltrion, MSD, Pfizer, Amgen,']}, {'Author': 'Alessandra Tedeschi', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen, BeiGene, AstraZeneca, AbbVie', ""Speakers' Bureau: AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Janssen, BeiGene""]}, {'Author': 'Judith Trotman', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: BeiGene, Roche/Genentech, Pharmacyclics, Janssen-Cilag, Takeda, Celgene', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche/Genentech']}, {'Author': 'RamÃ³n GarcÃ­a-Sanz', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Janssen, Takeda, Amgen, BeiGene, Novartis', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen', 'Research Funding: Gilead Sciences, Incyte', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: BIOMED-2 primers', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen, Takeda (I)', 'Other Relationship: Spanish Society of Hematology (SEHH)']}, {'Author': 'David MacDonald', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Celgene, Servier']}, {'Author': 'Veronique Leblond', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Roche Pharma AG, BeiGene, Amgen, Janssen Oncology, AbbVie, MSD Oncology, Lilly', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: BeiGene, Janssen, AstraZeneca, Lilly, AbbVie', ""Speakers' Bureau: BeiGene, AstraZeneca, AbbVie"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: AbbVie']}, {'Author': 'Charles Herbaux', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche, Janssen-Cilag, AbbVie', 'Research Funding: Takeda', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen-Cilag, AbbVie, Roche']}, {'Author': 'Jeffrey V.

Palma,"Purpose: The incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has risen rapidly, because of an epidemic of human papillomavirus infection. The optimal management of early-stage OPSCC with surgery or radiation continues to be a clinical controversy. Long-term randomized data comparing these paradigms are lacking.

Methods: We randomly assigned patients with T1-T2, N0-2 (â‰¤ 4 cm) OPSCC to radiotherapy (RT) (with chemotherapy if N1-2) versus transoral robotic surgery plus neck dissection (TORS + ND) (with or without adjuvant therapy). The primary end point was swallowing quality of life (QOL) at 1-year using the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory. Secondary end points included adverse events, other QOL outcomes, overall survival, and progression-free survival. All analyses were intention-to-treat. Herein, we present long-term outcomes from the trial.

Results: Sixty-eight patients were randomly assigned (n = 34 per arm) between August 10, 2012, and June 9, 2017. Median follow-up was 45 months. Longitudinal MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory analyses demonstrated statistical superiority of RT arm over time (P = .049), although the differences beyond 1 year were of smaller magnitude than at the 1-year timepoint (year 2: 86.0 Â± 13.5 in the RT arm v 84.8 Â± 12.5 in the TORS + ND arm, P = .74; year 3: 88.9 Â± 11.3 v 83.3 Â± 13.9, P = .12). These differences did not meet the threshold to qualify as a clinically meaningful change at any timepoint. Certain differences in QOL concerns including more pain and dental concerns in the TORS + ND arm seen at 1 year resolved at 2 and 3 years; however, TORS patients started to use more nutritional supplements at 3 years (P = .015). Dry mouth scores were higher in RT patients over time (P = .041).

Conclusion: On longitudinal analysis, the swallowing QOL difference between primary RT and TORS + ND approaches persists but decreases over time. Patients with OPSCC should be informed about the pros and cons of both treatment options (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01590355).",3/10/2022,"[{'Author': 'Anthony C.

Quinn,"Purpose: Orteronel (TAK-700) is a nonsteroidal 17,20-lyase inhibitor suppressing androgen synthesis. We evaluated the clinical benefit of orteronel when added to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.

Methods: In this open-label randomized phase III study, patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were randomly assigned 1:1 to ADT with orteronel (300 mg oral twice daily; experimental arm) or ADT with bicalutamide (50 mg oral once daily; control arm). The primary objective was the comparison of overall survival (OS), targeting a 33% improvement in median survival. A stratified log-rank test with a one-sided P â‰¤ .022 would indicate statistical significance. Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at 7 months (â‰¤ 0.2 v 0.2 to â‰¤ 4 v > 4 ng/mL), and adverse event profile.

Results: Among 1,279 patients included in the analysis, 638 were randomly assigned to the ADT plus orteronel arm and 641 to the control arm. The median age was 68 years; 49% had extensive disease. After a median follow-up of 4.9 years, there was a significant improvement in PFS (median 47.6 v 23.0 months, hazard ratio 0.58; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.67; P < .0001) and PSA response at 7 months (P < .0001), but not in OS (median 81.1 v 70.2 months, hazard ratio 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.02; P = .040, one-sided). More grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in the experimental versus the control arms (43% v 14%). Postprotocol life-prolonging therapy was received by 77.4% of patients in the control arm and 61.3% of patients in the orteronel arm.

Conclusion: The study did not meet the primary end point of improved OS with orteronel. The lack of correlation of PFS and PSA response with OS raises concerns over assumption of their consistent surrogacy for OS in the context of extensive postprotocol therapy in this setting.",10/1/2022,"[{'Author': 'Neeraj Agarwal', 'Disclosures': ['This author is a member of the Journal of Clinical Oncology Editorial Board.

This phase II trial evaluated volasertib or single-agent chemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant or -refractory ovarian cancer who experienced failure after treatment with two or three therapy lines.

Patients and Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either volasertib 300 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks or an investigatorâ€™s choice of single-agent, nonplatinum, cytotoxic chemotherapy. The primary end point was 24-week disease control rate. Secondary end points included best overall response, progression-free survival (PFS), safety, quality of life, and exploratory biomarker analyses.

Results: Of the 109 patients receiving treatment, 54 received volasertib and 55 received chemotherapy; demographics were well balanced. The 24-week disease control rates for volasertib and chemotherapy were 30.6% (95% CI, 18.0% to 43.2%) and 43.1% (95% CI, 29.6% to 56.7%), respectively, with partial responses in seven (13.0%) and eight (14.5%) patients, respectively. Median PFS was 13.1 weeks and 20.6 weeks for volasertib and chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.53). Six patients (11%) receiving volasertib achieved PFS fore more than 1 year, whereas no patient receiving chemotherapy achieved PFS greater than 1 year. No relationship between the expression of the biomarkers tested and their response was determined. Patients treated with volasertib experienced more grade 3 and 4 drug-related hematologic adverse events (AEs) and fewer nonhematologic AEs than did patients receiving chemotherapy. Discontinuation resulting from AEs occurred in seven (13.0%) and 15 (27.3%) patients in the volasertib and chemotherapy arms, respectively. Both arms showed similar effects on quality of life.

Conclusion: Single-agent volasertib showed antitumor activity in patients with ovarian cancer.

This was a phase I study to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and preliminary efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in an expanded MTD cohort of patients with relapsed or refractory CD22+ B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

Patients and Methods: Inotuzumab ozogamicin was administered intravenously as a single agent once every 3 or 4 weeks at doses ranging from 0.4 to 2.4 mg/m2. Outcomes included MTD, safety, pharmacokinetics, response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival.

Results: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled. The MTD was determined to be 1.8 mg/m2. Common adverse events at the MTD were thrombocytopenia (90%), asthenia (67%), and nausea and neutropenia (51% each). The objective response rate at the end of treatment was 39% for the 79 enrolled patients, 68% for all patients with follicular NHL treated at the MTD, and 15% for all patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated at the MTD. Median PFS was 317 days (approximately 10.4 months) and 49 days for patients with follicular NHL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, respectively.

Identification of Patients With Ovarian Cancer Experiencing the Highest Benefit From Bevacizumab in the First-Line Setting on the Basis of Their Tumor-Intrinsic Chemosensitivity (KELIM): The GOG-0218 Validation Study,Benoit  You; Christopher  Purdy; Larry J.  Copeland; Elizabeth M.  Swisher; Michael A.  Bookman; Gini  Fleming; Robert  Coleman; Leslie M.  Randall; Krishnansu S.  Tewari; Bradley J.  Monk; Robert S.  Mannel; Joan L.  Walker; Fabio  Cappuccini; David  Cohn; Mahvish  Muzaffar; David  Mutch; Andrea  Wahner-Hendrickson; Lainie  Martin; Olivier  Colomban; Robert A.  Burger,"Purpose: In patients with high-grade ovarian cancer, predictors of bevacizumab efficacy in first-line setting are needed. In the ICON-7 trial, a poor tumor intrinsic chemosensitivity (defined by unfavorable modeled cancer antigen-125 [CA-125] ELIMination rate constant K [KELIM] score) was a predictive biomarker. Only the patients with high-risk disease (suboptimally resected stage III, or stage IV) exhibiting unfavorable KELIM score < 1.0 had overall survival (OS) benefit from bevacizumab (median: 29.7 v 20.6 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.78). An external validation study in the GOG-0218 trial was performed.

Methods: In GOG-0218, 1,873 patients were treated with carboplatin-paclitaxel Â± concurrent-maintenance bevacizumab/placebo. Patient KELIM values were calculated with CA-125 kinetics during the first 100 chemotherapy days by the Lyon University team. The association between KELIM score (favorable â‰¥ 1.0, or unfavorable < 1.0) and bevacizumab benefit for progression-free survival (PFS)/OS was independently assessed by NGR-GOG using univariate/multivariate analyses.

Results: KELIM was assessable in 1,662 patients with â‰¥ 3 CA-125 available values. An unfavorable KELIM score was associated with bevacizumab benefit compared with placebo (PFS: HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.82; OS: HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.03), whereas a favorable KELIM was not (PFS: HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.17; OS: HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.39). The highest benefit was observed in patients with a high-risk disease exhibiting unfavorable KELIM, for PFS (median: 9.1 v 5.6 months; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.78), and for OS (median: 35.1 v 29.1 months; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97).

Conclusion: This GOG-0218 trial investigation validates ICON-7 findings about the association between poor tumor chemosensitivity and benefit from concurrent-maintenance bevacizumab, suggesting that bevacizumab may mainly be effective in patients with poorly chemosensitive disease. Bevacizumab may be prioritized in patients with a high-risk and poorly chemosensitive disease to improve their PFS/OS (patient KELIM score calculator available on the Biomarker Kinetics website).",12/1/2022,"[{'Author': 'Benoit You', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: `Roche/Genentech, AstraZeneca, Novartis, LEK, TESARO, Bayer, Amgen, Clovis Oncology, GlaxoSmithKline, ECS PROGASTRIN, Immunomedics, Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH, Myriad Genetics, MSD Oncology, Seattle Genetics', 'Research Funding: Merck Serono (Inst), Roche/Genentech (Inst), Clovis Oncology (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche/Genentech, AstraZeneca, BMS, MSD Oncology, Bayer']}, {'Author': 'Larry J.

These results were used to identify and cross-validate the GS, which was then applied to the NSCLC data.

Results: In the patients with melanoma, 84 genes were identified whose expression was potentially associated with clinical benefit. This effect was strongest when the immunostimulant AS15 was included in the immunotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] for overall survival, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.13 to 1.05; P = .06) and was less strong with the other immunostimulant AS02B (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.97; P = .70). The same GS was then used to predict the outcome for patients with resected NSCLC treated with MAGE-A3 plus AS02B; actively treated GS-positive patients showed a favorable disease-free interval compared with placebo-treated GS-positive patients (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.17 to 1.03; P = .06), whereas among GS-negative patients, no such difference was found (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.59 to 2.31; P = .65). The genes identified were mainly immune related, involving interferon gamma pathways and specific chemokines, suggesting that their pretreatment expression influences the tumor's immune microenvironment and the patient's clinical response.

Conclusion: An 84-gene GS associated with clinical response for MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic was identified in metastatic melanoma and confirmed in resected NSCLC.",7/1/2013,"[{'Author': 'Fernando Ulloa-Montoya', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines']}, {'Author': 'Jamila Louahed', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines']}, {'Author': 'Benjamin Dizier', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines']}, {'Author': 'Olivier Gruselle', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines']}, {'Author': 'Bart Spiessens', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines']}, {'Author': 'FrÃ©dÃ©ric F.

Hypofractionated Postmastectomy Radiation Therapy Is Safe and Effective: First Results From a Prospective Phase II Trial,Atif J.  Khan; Matthew M.  Poppe; Sharad  Goyal; Kristine E.  Kokeny; Thomas  Kearney; Laurie  Kirstein; Deborah  Toppmeyer; Dirk F.  Moore; Chunxia  Chen; David K.  Gaffney; Bruce G.  Haffty,"Purpose: Conventionally fractionated postmastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) takes approximately 5 to 6 weeks. Data supporting hypofractionated PMRT is limited. We prospectively evaluated a short course of hypofractionated PMRT, in which therapy was completed in 15 treatment days.

Patients and Methods: We delivered PMRT at a dose of 36.63 Gy in 11 fractions of 3.33 Gy over 11 days to the chest wall and the draining regional lymph nodes, followed by an optional mastectomy scar boost of four fractions of 3.33 Gy. Our primary end point was freedom from any grade 3 or higher toxicities. We incorporated early stopping criteria on the basis of predefined toxicity thresholds.

Results: We enrolled 69 women with stage II to IIIa breast cancer, of whom 67 were eligible for analysis. After a median follow-up of 32 months, there were no grade 3 toxicities. There were 29 reported grade 2 toxicities, with grade 2 skin toxicities being the most frequent (16 of 67; 24%). There were two patients with isolated ipsilateral chest wall tumor recurrences (2 of 67; crude rate, 3%). Three-year estimated local recurrence-free survival was 89.2% (95% CI, 0.748 to 0.956). The 3-year estimated distant recurrence-free survival was 90.3% (95% CI, 0.797 to 0.956). Forty-one patients had chest wall reconstructions; three had expanders removed for infection before radiation therapy. The total rate of implant loss or failure was 24% (9 of 38), and the unplanned surgical correction rate was 8% (3 of 38), for a total complication rate of 32%.

Conclusion: To our knowledge, our phase II prospective study offers one of the shortest courses of PMRT reported, delivered in 11 fractions to the chest wall and nodes and 15 fractions inclusive of a boost. We demonstrated low toxicity and high local control with this schedule. On the basis of our data, we have designed a cooperative group phase III prospective, randomized trial of conventional versus hypofractionated PMRT that will activate soon.",6/20/2017,"[{'Author': 'Atif J.

Pomalidomide Plus Low-Dose Dexamethasone in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma and Renal Impairment: Results From a Phase II Trial,Meletios  Dimopoulos; Katja  Weisel; Niels W.C.J.  van de Donk; Karthik  Ramasamy; Barbara  Gamberi; Matthew  Streetly; Massimo  Offidani; Frank  Bridoux; Javier  de la Rubia; Maria-Victoria  Mateos; Antonio  Ardizzoia; Elisabeth  Kueenburg; Shona  Collins; Antonia  Di Micco; Barbara  Rosettani; Yan  Li; Pamela  Bacon; Pieter  Sonneveld,"Purpose: Renal impairment (RI) limits treatment options in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Here, we prospectively studied pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (LoDEX) in patients with RRMM and moderate or severe RI, including those receiving hemodialysis.

Patients and Methods: MM-013, a noncomparative, European phase II trial, enrolled three patient cohorts: moderate RI (cohort A; estimated glomerular filtration rate, 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2); severe RI (cohort B; estimated glomerular filtration rate, < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2); and severe RI that requires hemodialysis (cohort C). Patients received pomalidomide 4 mg/d on days 1 to 21 and LoDEX 20 or 40 mg once per week in 28-day cycles. The primary end point was overall response rate.

Results: Of 81 enrolled patients (33, 34, and 14 patients in cohorts A, B, and C, respectively), 13 were still receiving treatment at data cutoff (January 28, 2017). Overall response rates were 39.4%, 32.4%, and 14.3%, with a median duration of response of 14.7 months, 4.6 months, and not estimable, respectively. Of importance, 100%, 79.4%, and 78.6% of patients, respectively, achieved disease control. With a median follow-up of 8.6 months, median overall survival was 16.4 months, 11.8 months, and 5.2 months, respectively. Complete renal responses were observed only in cohort A (18.2%), and no patients in cohort C became hemodialysis independent. Grade 3 and 4 hematologic treatment-emergent adverse events and pomalidomide discontinuations as a result of treatment-emergent adverse events occurred more frequently in cohort C. Pomalidomide pharmacokinetics were comparable among the three renal cohorts.

Conclusion: Pomalidomide 4 mg/d plus LoDEX is efficacious in patients with RRMM with moderate or severe RI, including those who had more advanced disease and required hemodialysis.

Patients and Methods: The primary end point was to determine the 5-year difference in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) between 30 Gy in 5 once-daily fractions (APBI arm) and 50 Gy in 25 fractions with a tumor bed boost (WBI arm) after breast-conserving surgery.

Results: Five hundred twenty patients, more than 90% of whom had characteristics associated with low recurrence risk, were randomly assigned (WBI, n = 260; APBI, n = 260) between 2005 and 2013. Median follow-up was 10.7 years. The 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR was 2.5% (n = 6) in the WBI and 3.7% (n = 9) in the APBI arm (hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; 95% CI, 0.55 to 4.37; P = .40). Overall survival at 10 years was 91.9% in both arms (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.79; P = .86). Breast cancerâ€“specific survival at 10 years was 96.7% in the WBI and 97.8% in the APBI arm (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.21 to 1.99; P = .45). The APBI arm showed significantly less acute toxicity (P = .0001) and late toxicity (P = .0001) and improved cosmetic outcome as evaluated by both physician (P = .0001) and patient (P = .0001).

Conclusion: The 10-year cumulative IBTR incidence in early breast cancer treated with external APBI using IMRT technique in 5 once-daily fractions is low and not different from that after WBI.

Ho,"Purpose: Recurrent or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (R/M ACC) is a malignant neoplasm of predominantly salivary gland origin for which effective therapies are lacking. We conducted a phase II trial evaluating the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib in patients with R/M ACC.

Patients and Methods: This study was conducted with a two-stage minimax design. Patients with histologically confirmed R/M ACC of any primary site with radiographic and/or symptomatic progression were eligible. Any prior therapy was allowed except previous lenvatinib. Patients received lenvatinib 24 mg orally per day. The primary end point was overall response rate. Secondary end points were progression-free survival and safety. An exploratory analysis of how MYB expression and genomic alterations relate to outcomes was conducted.

Results: Thirty-three patients were enrolled; 32 were evaluable for the primary end point. Five patients (15.6%) had a confirmed partial response, 24 patients (75%) had stable disease, two patients (6.3%) discontinued treatment as a result of toxicity before the first scan, and one patient (3.1%) had progression of disease as best response. Median progression-free survival time was 17.5 months (95% CI, 7.2 months to not reached), although only eight progression events were observed. Patients otherwise were removed for toxicity (n = 5), as a result of withdrawal of consent (n = 9), or at the treating physicianâ€™s discretion (n = 6). Twenty-three patients required at least one dose modification, and 18 of 32 patients discontinued lenvatinib for drug-related issues. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hypertension (n = 9; 28.1%) and oral pain (n = 3; 9.4%). Three grade 4 adverse events were observed (myocardial infarction, n = 1; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, n = 1; and intracranial hemorrhage, n = 1).

Conclusion: This trial met the prespecified overall response rate primary end point, demonstrating antitumor activity with lenvatinib in R/M ACC patients.

Adjuvant brachytherapy may reduce LR This multicenter randomized trial compares SR to SR with brachytherapy (SRB).

Patients and Methods: High-risk operable patients with NSCLC â‰¤ 3 cm were randomly assigned to SR or SRB. The primary end point was time to LR, where LR included recurrence at the staple line (local progression), in the primary tumor lobe away from the staple line, and in ipsilateral hilar nodes. The trial was designed to have a 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.315 in favor of SRB, using a one-sided type I error rate of 0.05 with a sample size of 100 eligible patients in each arm.

Results: Two hundred twenty-four patients were randomly assigned; 222 patients were evaluable for intent-to-treat analysis. Median age was 71 years (range, 49 to 87 years). No differences were found in baseline characteristics. Median follow-up time was 4.38 years (range, 0.04 to 5.59 years). There was no difference in time to LR (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.98; log-rank P = .98) or in the types of LR. Local progression occurred in only 17 (7.7%) of 222 patients. In patients with potentially compromised margins (margin < 1 cm, margin-to-tumor ratio < 1, positive staple line cytology, wedge resection, nodule size > 2.0 cm), SRB did not reduce LR, although trends favored the SRB arm. This was most marked in 14 patients with positive staple line cytology (HR, 0.22; P = .24). Three-year overall survival rates were similar for patients in the SR (71%) and SRB (71%) arms (P = .97).

Newman; Mitchell  Dowsett,"Purpose: At least 94 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with breast cancer. The extent to which an SNP panel can refine risk in women who receive preventive therapy has not been directly assessed previously.

Materials and Methods: A risk score on the basis of 88 SNPs (SNP88) was investigated in a nested case-control study of women enrolled in the International Breast Intervention Study (IBIS-I) or the Royal Marsden study. A total of 359 women who developed cancer were matched to 636 controls by age, trial, follow-up time, and treatment arm. Genotyping was done using the OncoArray. Conditional logistic regression and matched concordance indices (mC) were used to measure the performance of SNP88 alone and with other breast cancer risk factors assessed using the Tyrer-Cuzick (TC) model.

Results: SNP88 was predictive of breast cancer risk overall (interquartile range odds ratio [IQ-OR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.66; mC, 0.55), but mainly for estrogen receptorâ€“positive disease (IQ-OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.79; P for heterogeneity = .10) versus estrogen receptorâ€“negative disease. However, the observed risk of SNP88 was only 46% (95% CI, 19% to 74%) of expected. No significant interaction was observed with treatment arm (placebo IQ-OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.87; tamoxifen IQ-OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.64; P for heterogeneity = .5). The predictive power was similar to the TC model (IQ-OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.73; mC, 0.55), but SNP88 was independent of TC (Spearman rank-order correlation, 0.012; P = .7), and when combined multiplicatively, a substantial improvement was seen (IQ-OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.36 to 1.97; mC, 0.60).

Conclusion: A polygenic risk score may be used to refine risk from the TC or similar models in women who are at an elevated risk of breast cancer and considering preventive therapy.

Patients and Methods: PROs were assessed on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30-item and the EuroQol 5-dimensional descriptive system at baseline and every 3 months during treatment. By mixed-effects model, changes from baseline are presented as least squares means with 95% CIs.

Results: A total of 737 transplant-ineligible (TIE) patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were randomly assigned to D-Rd (n = 368) or Rd (n = 369). Compliance with PRO assessments was high at baseline (> 90%) through month 12 (> 78%) for both groups.

Schell; Gerold Bepler,"Purpose: Src family kinase (SFK) proteins are frequently activated in cancer and can coordinate tumor cell growth, survival, invasion, and angiogenesis. Given the importance of SFK signaling in cancer, known cooperation between SFK and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, and efficacy of EGFR inhibitors, we performed a phase I trial combining dasatinib, an SFK and multikinase inhibitor, with erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, in patients with advanced nonÃ¢â‚¬â€œsmall-cell lung cancer.

Patients and Methods: Patients received erlotinib for 1 week before addition of dasatinib; pharmacokinetics were performed after weeks 1 and 2. Four cohorts were examined, including twice-daily and daily dasatinib dosing. Responses were assessed after 8 weeks. Plasma levels of angiogenic markers (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], interleukin-8, and basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]) were determined before and during treatment.

Results: Thirty-four patients were enrolled. The average duration of treatment was 73 days. The main adverse events include GI (diarrhea, anorexia, and nausea), skin rash, cytopenias, pleural effusions, and fatigue. No effect of escalating doses of dasatinib was observed on erlotinib pharmacokinetics. Two partial responses and one bone response were observed, and the disease control rate was 63%. Reductions in plasma VEGF and bFGF were observed, and reductions in VEGF correlated with disease control.

Conclusion: The combination of erlotinib and dasatinib is tolerable, with adverse effects consistent with the two agents. Disease control and inhibition of plasma angiogenesis markers were observed. Personalized strategies for deployment of SFK should receive further attention.",3/10/2010,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'Alberto Chiappori', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role: Genentech']}, {'Author': 'Gerold Bepler', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role: OSI Pharmaceuticals']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Stock Ownership:']}, {'Author': 'Alberto Chiappori', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Genentech']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Expert Testimony:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Other Remuneration:']}]",erlotinib,OSI Pharmaceuticals,0,1,The main drug is dasatinib
A Practical Solution for Dyspareunia in Breast Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Martha F. Goetsch; Jeong Y. Lim; Aaron B. Caughey,"Purpose: Dyspareunia is common in breast cancer survivors because of low estrogen. This study explored whether dyspareunia is introital pain, preventable with analgesic liquid.

Patients and Methods: In a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, estrogen-deficient breast cancer survivors with severe penetrative dyspareunia applied either saline or 4% aqueous lidocaine to the vulvar vestibule for 3 minutes before vaginal penetration. After a 1-month blinded trial of patient-assessed twice-per-week tampon insertion or intercourse, all patients received lidocaine for 2 months in an open-label trial. The primary outcome was patient-related assessment of penetration pain on a scale of zero to 10. Secondary outcomes were sexual distress (Female Sexual Distress Scale), sexual function (Sexual Function Questionnaire), and resumption of intercourse. Comparisons were made with the Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed rank test with significance set at P < .05.

Results: In all, 46 patients, screened to exclude those with pelvic muscle and organ pain, uniformly had clinical evidence of severe vulvovaginal atrophy, dyspareunia (median pain score, 8 of 10; interquartile range [IQR], 7 to 9), increased sexual distress scores (median, 30.5; IQR, 23 to 37; abnormal, > 11), and abnormal sexual function. Users of lidocaine reported less pain during intercourse in the blinded phase (median score of 1.0 compared with saline score of 5.3; P = .007). After open-label lidocaine use, 37 (90%) of 41 reported comfortable penetration. Sexual distress decreased (median score, 14; IQR, 3 to 20; P < .001), and sexual function improved in all but one domain. Of 20 prior abstainers from intercourse who completed the study, 17 (85%) had resumed comfortable penetrative intimacy. No partners reported penile numbness.

Conclusion: Breast cancer survivors with menopausal dyspareunia can have comfortable intercourse after applying liquid lidocaine compresses to the vulvar vestibule before penetration.",10/20/2015,"[{'Author': 'Martha F.

Randomized Phase III Trial of Gemcitabine-Based Chemotherapy With In Situ RRM1 and ERCC1 Protein Levels for Response Prediction in Nonâ€“Small-Cell Lung Cancer,Craig Reynolds; Coleman Obasaju; Michael J. Schell; Xueli Li; Zhong Zheng; David Boulware; John R. Caton; Linda C. DeMarco; Mark A. O'Rourke; Gail Shaw Wright; Kristi A. Boehm; Lina Asmar; Jane Bromund; Guangbin Peng; Matthew J. Monberg; Gerold Bepler,"Purpose: We evaluated the efficacy of gemcitabine versus gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with advanced nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a performance status (PS) of 2 and assessed if tumoral RRM1 and ERCC1 protein levels are predictive of response to therapy.

Patients and Methods: A randomized phase III trial was conducted in community-based oncology practices. Tumor specimens were collected a priori and shipped to a single laboratory for blinded determination of in situ RRM1 and ERCC1 protein expression levels by an automated quantitative immunofluorescent-based technology.

Results: One hundred seventy patients were randomly assigned. Overall median survival was 5.1 months for gemcitabine and 6.7 months for gemcitabine and carboplatin (P = .24). RRM1 (range, 5.3 to 105.6; median, 34.1) and ERCC1 (range, 5.2 to 131.3; median, 34.7) values were significantly and inversely correlated with disease response (r = âˆ’0.41; P = .001 for RRM1; r = âˆ’0.39; P = .003 for ERCC1; ie, response was better for patients with low levels of expression). A model for response prediction that included RRM1, ERCC1, and treatment arm, was highly predictive of the treatment response observed (P = .0005). We did not find statistically significant associations between survival and RRM1 or ERCC1 levels.

Conclusion: Single-agent chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC and poor PS. Quantitative analysis of RRM1 and ERCC1 protein expression in routinely collected tumor specimens in community oncology practices is predictive of response to gemcitabine and gemcitabine and carboplatin therapy.

Monk,"Purpose: To assess efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin (C) and gemcitabine (G) with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients with locally advanced vulvar cancer not amenable to surgery.

Methods: Patients enrolled in a single-arm phase II study. Pretreatment inguinal-femoral nodal assessment was performed. Sixty-four Gy IMRT was prescribed to the vulva, with 50-64 Gy delivered to the groins/low pelvis. Radiation therapy (RT) plans were quality-reviewed pretreatment. C 40 mg/m2 and G 50 mg/m2 were administered once per week throughout IMRT. Complete pathologic response (CPR) was the primary end point. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and adverse events were assessed with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0.

Results: Fifty-seven patients enrolled, of which 52 were evaluable. The median age was 58 years (range, 25-58), and 94% were White. Forty (77%) had stage II or III disease, and all had squamous histology. A median of six chemotherapy cycles (range, 1-8) were received. Eighty-five percent of RT plans were quality-reviewed with 100% compliance to protocol. Seven patients came off trial because of toxicity or patient withdrawal. Of 52 patients available for pathologic assessment, 38 (73% [90% CI, 61 to 83]) achieved CPR. No pelvic exenterations were performed. With a median follow-up of 51 months, the 12-month PFS was 74% (90% CI, 62.2 to 82.7) and the 24-month OS was 70% (90% CI, 57 to 79). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hematologic toxicity and radiation dermatitis. There was one grade 5 event unlikely related to treatment.

Multicenter Phase II Trial of Temsirolimus and Bevacizumab in Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors,Timothy J. Hobday; Rui Qin; Diane Reidy-Lagunes; Malcolm J. Moore; Jonathan Strosberg; Andreas Kaubisch; Manisha Shah; Hedy Lee Kindler; Heinz-Josef Lenz; Helen Chen; Charles Erlichman,"Purpose: There are few effective therapies for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). Recent placebo-controlled phase III trials of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor sunitinib have noted improved progression-free survival (PFS). Preclinical studies have suggested enhanced antitumor effects with combined mTOR and VEGF pathwayâ€“targeted therapy. We conducted a clinical trial to evaluate combination therapy against these targets in PNETs.

Patients and Methods: We conducted a two-stage single-arm phase II trial of the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus 25 mg intravenously (IV) once per week and the VEGF-A monoclonal antibody bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV once every 2 weeks in patients with well or moderately differentiated PNETs and progressive disease by RECIST within 7 months of study entry. Coprimary end points were tumor response rate and 6-month PFS.

Results: A total of 58 patients were enrolled, and 56 patients were eligible for response assessment. Confirmed response rate (RR) was 41% (23 of 56 patients). PFS at 6 months was 79% (44 of 56). Median PFS was 13.2 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 16.6). Median overall survival was 34 months (95% CI, 27.1 to not reached). For evaluable patients, the most common grade 3 to 4 adverse events attributed to therapy were hypertension (21%), fatigue (16%), lymphopenia (14%), and hyperglycemia (14%).

Conclusion: The combination of temsirolimus and bevacizumab had substantial activity and reasonable tolerability in a multicenter phase II trial, with RR of 41%, well in excess of single targeted agents in patients with progressive PNETs.

Brown,"Purpose: Organ-sparing therapy for early-stage I/IIA rectal cancer is intended to avoid functional disturbances or a permanent ostomy associated with total mesorectal excision (TME). The objective of this phase II trial was to determine the outcomes and organ-sparing rate of patients with early-stage rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by transanal excision surgery (TES).

Methods: This phase II trial included patients with clinical T1-T3abN0 low- or mid-rectal adenocarcinoma eligible for endoscopic resection who were treated with 3 months of chemotherapy (modified folinic acidâ€“fluorouracil-oxaliplatin 6 or capecitabine-oxaliplatin). Those with evidence of response proceeded to transanal endoscopic surgery 2-6 weeks later. The primary end point was protocol-specified organ preservation rate, defined as the proportion of patients with tumor downstaging to ypT0/T1N0/X and who avoided radical surgery.

Results: Of 58 patients enrolled, all commenced chemotherapy and 56 proceeded to surgery. A total of 33/58 patients had tumor downstaging to ypT0/1N0/X on the surgery specimen, resulting in an intention-to-treat protocol-specified organ preservation rate of 57% (90% CI, 45 to 68). Of 23 remaining patients recommended for TME surgery on the basis of protocol requirements, 13 declined and elected to proceed directly to observation resulting in 79% (90% CI, 69 to 88) achieving organ preservation. The remaining 10/23 patients proceeded to recommended TME of whom seven had no histopathologic residual disease. The 1-year and 2-year locoregional relapse-free survival was, respectively, 98% (95% CI, 86 to 100) and 90% (95% CI, 58 to 98), and there were no distant recurrences or deaths. Minimal change in quality of life and rectal function scores was observed.

Conclusion: Three months of induction chemotherapy may successfully downstage a significant proportion of patients with early-stage rectal cancer, allowing well-tolerated organ-preserving surgery.",1/10/2023,"[{'Author': 'Hagen F.

In Protocol B, patients with tumor-negative SLN by standard histopathology and immunohistochemistry underwent molecular staging by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Patients positive by RT-PCR were randomly assigned to observation versus CLND versus CLND+HDI. Primary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

Results: In the Protocol A intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences in DFS (hazard ratio, 0.82; P = .45) or OS (hazard ratio, 1.10; P = .68) for patients randomly assigned to HDI versus observation. In the Protocol B intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant differences in overall DFS (P = .069) or OS (P = .77) across the three randomized treatment arms. Similarly, efficacy analysis (excluding patients who did not receive the assigned treatment) did not demonstrate significant differences in DFS or OS in Protocol A or Protocol B. Median follow-up time was 71 months.

Conclusion: No survival benefit for adjuvant HDI in patients with a single positive SLN was found. Among patients with tumor-negative SLN by conventional pathology but with melanoma detected in the SLN by RT-PCR, there was no OS benefit for CLND or CLND+HDI.",4/1/2016,"[{'Author': 'Kelly M.

Fisher; Jonathan W.  Friedberg; Oliver W.  Press,"Purpose: SWOG S0016 was a phase III randomized study that compared the safety and efficacy of R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) with CHOP-RIT (CHOP followed by consolidation with iodine-133â€“tositumomab radioimmunotherapy) for previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma. Understanding the long-term outcome of patients provides a benchmark for novel treatment regimens for FL.

Patients and Methods: Between 2001 and 2008, 531 previously untreated patients with FL were randomly assigned to receive either six cycles of R-CHOP or six cycles of CHOP-RIT. Patients with advanced-stage disease (bulky stage II, III, or IV) of any pathologic grade (1, 2, or 3) were eligible.

Results: After a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 10-year estimates of progression-free and overall survival were 49% and 78% among all patients, respectively. Patients in the CHOP-RIT arm had significantly better 10-year progression-free survival compared with patients in the R-CHOP arm (56% v 42%; P = .01), but 10-year overall survival was not different between the two arms (75% v 81%; P = .13). There was no significant difference between the CHOP-RIT and R-CHOP arms in regard to incidence of second malignancies (15.1% v 16.1%; P = .81) or myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia (4.9% v 1.8%; P = .058). The estimated 10-year cumulative incidences of death resulting from second malignancies were not different (7.1% v 3.2%; P = .16), but cumulative incidence of death resulting from myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia was higher in the CHOP-RIT arm compared with the R-CHOP arm (4% v 0.9%; P = .02).

Conclusion: Given these outstanding outcomes, immunochemotherapy should remain the standard induction approach for patients with high-risk FL until long-term follow-up of alternative approaches demonstrates superiority.",3/1/2018,"[{'Author': 'Mazyar Shadman', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AbbVie', 'Research Funding: Pharmacyclics (Inst), Gilead Sciences (Inst), Acerta Pharma (Inst), TG Therapeutics (Inst), Merck (Inst), Celgene (Inst), Genentech (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Hongli Li', 'Disclosures': ['No relationship to disclose']}, {'Author': 'Lisa Rimsza', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Celgene', 'Research Funding: ProNAi', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Coinventor on patent undergoing commercialization by NanoString']}, {'Author': 'John P.

Freeman; Scott J. Rodig; Deepika Cattry; Lili Zhu; Joseph F. Grosso; M. Brigid Bradley Garelik; Margaret A. Shipp; Ivan Borrello; John Timmerman,"Purpose: Cancer cells can exploit the programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint pathway to avoid immune surveillance by modulating T-lymphocyte activity. In part, this may occur through overexpression of PD-1 and PD-1 pathway ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) in the tumor microenvironment. PD-1 blockade has produced significant antitumor activity in solid tumors, and similar evidence has emerged in hematologic malignancies.

Methods: In this phase I, open-label, dose-escalation, cohort-expansion study, patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma received the antiâ€“PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab at doses of 1 or 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nivolumab and to assess PD-L1/PD-L2 locus integrity and protein expression.

Results: Eighty-one patients were treated (follicular lymphoma, n = 10; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, n = 11; other B-cell lymphomas, n = 10; mycosis fungoides, n = 13; peripheral T-cell lymphoma, n = 5; other T-cell lymphomas, n = 5; multiple myeloma, n = 27). Patients had received a median of three (range, one to 12) prior systemic treatments. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 51 (63%) patients, and most were grade 1 or 2. Objective response rates were 40%, 36%, 15%, and 40% among patients with follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, respectively. Median time of follow-up observation was 66.6 weeks (range, 1.6 to 132.0+ weeks). Durations of response in individual patients ranged from 6.0 to 81.6+ weeks.

Conclusion: Nivolumab was well tolerated and exhibited antitumor activity in extensively pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory B- and T-cell lymphomas.

"Phase I Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Dose-Escalation Study of RG7160 (GA201), the First Glycoengineered Monoclonal Antibody Against the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors ",Luis G. Paz-Ares; Carlos Gomez-Roca; Jean-Pierre Delord; Andres Cervantes; Ben Markman; Jesus Corral; Jean-Charles Soria; Yann BergÃ©; Desamparados Roda; Fiona Russell-Yarde; Simon Hollingsworth; JosÃ© Baselga; Pablo Umana; Luigi Manenti; Josep Tabernero,"Purpose: We conducted a phase I dose-escalation study to characterize the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic properties of RG7160 (GA201), a humanized and glycoengineered immunoglobulin G1 antiâ€“epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody with enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

Patients and Methods: Seventy-five patients with advanced EGFR-positive solid tumors received RG7160 (50 to 1,400 mg) administered every week, every 2 weeks, or every 3 weeks. Dose escalation followed a three-plus-three trial design.

Results: No maximum-tolerated dose was reached for any dosing schedule. Common adverse events (AEs) included rash (80% of patients), infusion-related reactions (77%), and hypomagnesemia (56%). Grades 3 and 4 AEs were rash (grade 3, 25%), infusion-related reaction (grade 3, 7%; grade 4, 1%), paronychia (grade 3, 3%), and hypomagnesemia (grade 3, 1%; grade 4, 1%). RG7160 exposure increased greater than proportionally over the 50- to 400-mg dose range (with greater than proportional decline in clearance) and approximately dose proportionally above 400 mg (where clearance plateaued). A marked reduction in circulating natural killer cells and increased infiltration of immune effector cells into skin rash were seen. Clinical efficacy included one complete response and two partial responses in patients with colorectal cancer (including one with KRAS mutation) and disease stabilization in 27 patients.

Conclusion: RG7160 had an acceptable safety profile with manageable AEs and demonstrated promising efficacy in this heavily pretreated patient cohort. On the basis of modeling of available PK parameters, the RG7160 dose selected for part two of this study is 1,400 mg on days 1 and 8 followed by 1,400 mg every 2 weeks.",10/1/2011,"[{'Author': 'Fiona Russell-Yarde', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: Roche']}, {'Author': 'Simon Hollingsworth', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: Roche']}, {'Author': 'Pablo Umana', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: Roche Glycart']}, {'Author': 'Luigi Manenti', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: Roche Glycart']}, {'Author': 'Luis G.

Morris,"Purpose: The combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) is a standard therapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Based on data that angiogenesis plays a role in urothelial carcinoma growth and progression, a randomized placebo-controlled trial was performed with the primary objective of testing whether patients treated with GC and bevacizumab (GCB) have superior overall survival (OS) than patients treated with GC and placebo (GCP).

Patients and Methods: Between July 2009 and December 2014, 506 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma without prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease and no neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy within 12 months were randomly assigned to receive either GCB or GCP. The primary end point was OS, with secondary end points of progression-free survival, objective response, and toxicity.

Results: With a median follow-up of 76.3 months among alive patients, the median OS was 14.5 months for patients treated with GCB and 14.3 months for patients treated with GCP (hazard ratio for death = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.05; two-sided stratified log-rank P = .14). The median progression-free survival was 8.0 months for GCB and 6.7 months for GCP (hazard ratio = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.95; P = .016). The proportion of patients with grade 3 or greater adverse events did not differ significantly between both arms, although increased bevacizumab-related toxicities such as hypertension and proteinuria occurred in the bevacizumab-treated arm.

Conclusion: The addition of bevacizumab to GC did not result in improved OS. The observed median OS of about 14 months is consistent with prior phase III trials of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.",8/1/2021,"[{'Author': 'Jonathan E.

Phase II Multicenter Trial of Imatinib in 10 Histologic Subtypes of Sarcoma Using a Bayesian Hierarchical Statistical Model,Rashmi Chugh; J. Kyle Wathen; Robert G. Maki; Robert S. Benjamin; Shreyaskumar R. Patel; Paul A. Myers; Dennis A. Priebat; Denise K. Reinke; Dafydd G. Thomas; Mary L. Keohan; Brian L. Samuels; Laurence H. Baker,"Purpose: The purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy of imatinib in patients with one of 10 different subtypes of advanced sarcoma.

Patients and Methods: Eligible patients were treated daily with imatinib dosed at 300 mg twice a day (for body-surface area â‰¥ 1.5 m2). The primary end point was response (clinical benefit response [CBR]), defined as complete (CR) or partial response (PR) at 2 months, or stable disease, CR, or PR at 4 months. Rules for early termination within each disease type were based on a Bayesian hierarchical probability model (BHM) accounting for correlation of the responses of the 10 subtypes. Available tissue samples were analyzed for molecules within the KIT/platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signal transduction pathway.

Results: One hundred eighty-five assessable patients with one of 10 subtypes of sarcoma were treated. One CR and three PRs were achieved. A CBR was achieved in 28 patients treated overall and by subtype: two angiosarcomas (n = 16), 0 Ewing (n = 13), one fibrosarcoma (n = 12), six leiomyosarcomas (n = 29), seven liposarcomas (n = 31), three malignant fibrous histiocytomas (n = 30), five osteosarcomas (n = 27), one malignant peripheral-nerve sheath tumor (n = 7), 0 rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2), and three synovial sarcomas (n = 22). Variable expression and mutations within the KIT/PDGFR pathway were observed.

Conclusion: This is the first phase II study of a new agent in sarcoma to include sufficient patients with each of the common histologic subtypes to permit generalizable conclusions. The BHM is an effective method for studying rare diseases and their subtypes, when it is reasonable to assume that their response rates are exchangeable. Although rare dramatic responses were seen, imatinib is not an active agent in advanced sarcoma in these subtypes.",7/1/2009,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'Robert S.

Kristeleit,"Purpose: ATHENA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03522246) was designed to evaluate rucaparib first-line maintenance treatment in a broad patient population, including those without BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA) mutations or other evidence of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), or high-risk clinical characteristics such as residual disease. We report the results from the ATHENAâ€“MONO comparison of rucaparib versus placebo.

Methods: Patients with stage III-IV high-grade ovarian cancer undergoing surgical cytoreduction (R0/complete resection permitted) and responding to first-line platinum-doublet chemotherapy were randomly assigned 4:1 to oral rucaparib 600 mg twice a day or placebo. Stratification factors were HRD test status, residual disease after chemotherapy, and timing of surgery. The primary end point of investigator-assessed progression-free survival was assessed in a step-down procedure, first in the HRD population (BRCA-mutant or BRCA wild-type/loss of heterozygosity high tumor), and then in the intent-to-treat population.

Results: As of March 23, 2022 (data cutoff), 427 and 111 patients were randomly assigned to rucaparib or placebo, respectively (HRD population: 185 v 49). Median progression-free survival (95% CI) was 28.7 months (23.0 to not reached) with rucaparib versus 11.3 months (9.1 to 22.1) with placebo in the HRD population (log-rank P = .0004; hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.72); 20.2 months (15.2 to 24.7) versus 9.2 months (8.3 to 12.2) in the intent-to-treat population (log-rank P < .0001; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.68); and 12.1 months (11.1 to 17.7) versus 9.1 months (4.0 to 12.2) in the HRD-negative population (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.95). The most common grade â‰¥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events were anemia (rucaparib, 28.7% v placebo, 0%) and neutropenia (14.6% v 0.9%).

Conclusion: Rucaparib monotherapy is effective as first-line maintenance, conferring significant benefit versus placebo in patients with advanced ovarian cancer with and without HRD.",12/1/2022,"[{'Author': 'Bradley J.

Methods: This multicenter placebo-controlled double-blind randomized phase III trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03038100) enrolled patients with newly diagnosed untreated International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III or IV OC who either had undergone primary cytoreductive surgery with macroscopic residual disease or were planned to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and interval surgery. Patients were stratified by FIGO stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, tumor immune cell PD-L1 staining, and treatment strategy and randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 3-weekly cycles of atezolizumab 1,200 mg or placebo (day 1, cycles 1-22), with paclitaxel plus carboplatin (day 1, cycles 1-6) plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg (day 1, cycles 2-22), omitting perioperative bevacizumab in neoadjuvant patients. The co-primary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-to-treat and PD-L1â€“positive populations.

Results: Between March 8, 2017, and March 26, 2019, 1,301 patients were enrolled. The median progression-free survival was 19.5 versus 18.4 months with atezolizumab versus placebo, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.07; stratified log-rank P = .28), in the intention-to-treat population and 20.8 versus 18.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.99; P = .038), in the PD-L1â€“positive population. The interim (immature) overall survival results showed no significant benefit from atezolizumab. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (21% with atezolizumab v 21% with placebo), hypertension (18% v 20%, respectively), and anemia (12% v 12%).

Patients and Methods: Women with hormone receptorâ€“positive MBC were randomly assigned 1:1 in a multicenter, open-label, phase III trial of letrozole (2.5 mg orally per day) with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks) within strata defined by measurable disease and disease-free interval. This trial had 90% power to detect a 50% improvement in median PFS from 6 to 9 months. Using a one-sided Î± = .025, a target sample size of 352 patients was planned.

Results: From May 2008 to November 2011, 350 women were recruited; 343 received treatment and were observed for efficacy and safety. Median age was 58 years (range, 25 to 87 years). Sixty-two percent had measurable disease, and 45% had de novo MBC. At a median follow-up of 39 months, the addition of bevacizumab resulted in a significant reduction in the hazard of progression (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.96; P = .016) and a prolongation in median PFS from 15.6 months with letrozole to 20.2 months with letrozole plus bevacizumab. There was no significant difference in overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.18; P = .188), with median overall survival of 43.9 months with letrozole versus 47.2 months with letrozole plus bevacizumab. The largest increases in incidence of grade 3 to 4 treatment-related toxicities with the addition of bevacizumab were hypertension (24% v 2%) and proteinuria (11% v 0%).

Conclusion: The addition of bevacizumab to letrozole improved PFS in hormone receptorâ€“positive MBC, but this benefit was associated with a markedly increased risk of grade 3 to 4 toxicities. Research on predictive markers will be required to clarify the role of bevacizumab in this setting.",8/1/2016,"[{'Author': 'Maura N.

Turner,"Purpose: The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway is frequently activated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The AKT inhibitor capivasertib has shown preclinical activity in TNBC models, and drug sensitivity has been associated with activation of PI3K or AKT and/or deletions of PTEN. The PAKT trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding capivasertib to paclitaxel as first-line therapy for TNBC.

Patients and Methods: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase II trial recruited women with untreated metastatic TNBC. A total of 140 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 (days 1, 8, 15) with either capivasertib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo (days 2-5, 9-12, 16-19) every 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), PFS and OS in the subgroup with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations, tumor response, and safety.

Results: Median PFS was 5.9 months with capivasertib plus paclitaxel and 4.2 months with placebo plus paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.08; 1-sided P = .06 [predefined significance level, 1-sided P = .10]). Median OS was 19.1 months with capivasertib plus paclitaxel and 12.6 months with placebo plus paclitaxel (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.99; 2-sided P = .04). In patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumors (n = 28), median PFS was 9.3 months with capivasertib plus paclitaxel and 3.7 months with placebo plus paclitaxel (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.79; 2-sided P = .01). The most common grade â‰¥ 3 adverse events in those treated with capivasertib plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel, respectively, were diarrhea (13% v 1%), infection (4% v 1%), neutropenia (3% v 3%), rash (4% v 0%), and fatigue (4% v 0%).

Conclusion: Addition of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib to first-line paclitaxel therapy for TNBC resulted in significantly longer PFS and OS. Benefits were more pronounced in patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered tumors.

Petrylak,"Purpose: Locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma is an incurable disease with limited treatment options, especially for patients who were previously treated with platinum and antiâ€“programmed death 1 or antiâ€“programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/L1) therapy. Enfortumab vedotin is an antibodyâ€“drug conjugate that targets Nectin-4, which is highly expressed in urothelial carcinoma.

Methods: EV-201 is a global, phase II, single-arm study of enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg (intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-day cycle) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were previously treated with platinum chemotherapy and antiâ€“PD-1/L1 therapy. The primary end point was objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by blinded independent central review. Key secondary end points were duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, and tolerability.

Results: Enfortumab vedotin was administered to 125 patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Median follow-up was 10.2 months (range, 0.5 to 16.5 months). Confirmed objective response rate was 44% (95% CI, 35.1% to 53.2%), including 12% complete responses. Similar responses were observed in prespecified subgroups, such as those patients with liver metastases and those with no response to prior antiâ€“PD-1/L1 therapy. Median duration of response was 7.6 months (range, 0.95 to 11.30+ months). The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (50%), any peripheral neuropathy (50%), alopecia (49%), any rash (48%), decreased appetite (44%), and dysgeusia (40%). No single treatment-related adverse events grade 3 or greater occurred in 10% or more of patients.

Conclusion: Enfortumab vedotin demonstrated a clinically meaningful response rate with a manageable and tolerable safety profile in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who were previously treated with platinum and antiâ€“PD-1/L1 therapies.",10/10/2019,"[{'Author': 'Jonathan E.

Exemestane Versus Anastrozole in Postmenopausal Women With Early Breast Cancer: NCIC CTG MA.27â€”A Randomized Controlled Phase III Trial,Paul E. Goss; James N. Ingle; Kathleen I.

D'Souza; Haji Chalchal; Silvana Spadafora; Vered Stearns; Edith A. Perez; Pedro E.R. Liedke; Istvan Lang; Catherine Elliott; Karen A. Gelmon; Judy-Anne W. Chapman; Lois E. Shepherd,"Purpose: In patients with hormone-dependent postmenopausal breast cancer, standard adjuvant therapy involves 5 years of the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole. The steroidal inhibitor exemestane is partially nonâ€“cross-resistant with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors and is a mild androgen and could prove superior to anastrozole regarding efficacy and toxicity, specifically with less bone loss.

Patients and Methods: We designed an open-label, randomized, phase III trial of 5 years of exemestane versus anastrozole with a two-sided test of superiority to detect a 2.4% improvement with exemestane in 5-year event-free survival (EFS). Secondary objectives included assessment of overall survival, distant diseaseâ€“free survival, incidence of contralateral new primary breast cancer, and safety.

Results: In the study, 7,576 women (median age, 64.1 years) were enrolled. At median follow-up of 4.1 years, 4-year EFS was 91% for exemestane and 91.2% for anastrozole (stratified hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.18; P = .85). Overall, distant diseaseâ€“free survival and disease-specific survival were also similar. In all, 31.6% of patients discontinued treatment as a result of adverse effects, concomitant disease, or study refusal. Osteoporosis/osteopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, vaginal bleeding, and hypercholesterolemia were less frequent on exemestane, whereas mild liver function abnormalities and rare episodes of atrial fibrillation were less frequent on anastrozole. Vasomotor and musculoskeletal symptoms were similar between arms.

Conclusion: This first comparison of steroidal and nonsteroidal classes of aromatase inhibitors showed neither to be superior in terms of breast cancer outcomes as 5-year initial adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal breast cancer by two-way test. Less toxicity on bone is compatible with one hypothesis behind MA.27 but requires confirmation. Exemestane should be considered another option as up-front adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal hormone receptorâ€“positive breast cancer.",4/10/2013,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'Kathleen I.

Knoblauch; Byoung Chul  Cho,"Purpose: Nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion (Exon20ins) mutations exhibits inherent resistance to approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Amivantamab, an EGFR-MET bispecific antibody with immune cellâ€“directing activity, binds to each receptor's extracellular domain, bypassing resistance at the tyrosine kinase inhibitor binding site.

Methods: CHRYSALIS is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study, which included a population with EGFR Exon20ins NSCLC. The primary end points were dose-limiting toxicity and overall response rate. We report findings from the postplatinum EGFR Exon20ins NSCLC population treated at the recommended phase II dose of 1,050 mg amivantamab (1,400 mg, â‰¥ 80 kg) given once weekly for the first 4 weeks and then once every 2 weeks starting at week 5.

Results: In the efficacy population (n = 81), the median age was 62 years (range, 42-84 years); 40 patients (49%) were Asian, and the median number of previous lines of therapy was two (range, 1-7). The overall response rate was 40% (95% CI, 29 to 51), including three complete responses, with a median duration of response of 11.1 months (95% CI, 6.9 to not reached). The median progression-free survival was 8.3 months (95% CI, 6.5 to 10.9). In the safety population (n = 114), the most common adverse events were rash in 98 patients (86%), infusion-related reactions in 75 (66%), and paronychia in 51 (45%). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were hypokalemia in six patients (5%) and rash, pulmonary embolism, diarrhea, and neutropenia in four (4%) each. Treatment-related dose reductions and discontinuations were reported in 13% and 4% of patients, respectively.

Kim,"Purpose: To assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides (MF) or SÃ©zary syndrome (SS).

Patients and Methods: CITN-10 is a single-arm, multicenter phase II trial of 24 patients with advanced MF or SS. Patients were treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks for up to 24 months. The primary end point was overall response rate by consensus global response criteria.

Results: Patients had advanced-stage disease (23 of 24 with stage IIB to IV MF/SS) and were heavily pretreated with a median of four prior systemic therapies. The overall response rate was 38% with two complete responses and seven partial responses. Of the nine responding patients, six had 90% or more improvement in skin disease by modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool, and eight had ongoing responses at last follow-up. The median duration of response was not reached, with a median response follow-up time of 58 weeks. Immune-related adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in four patients. A transient worsening of erythroderma and pruritus occurred in 53% of patients with SS. This cutaneous flare reaction did not result in treatment discontinuation for any patient. The flare reaction correlated with high PD-1 expression on SÃ©zary cells but did not associate with subsequent clinical responses or lack of response. Treatment responses did not correlate with expression of PD-L1, total mutation burden, or an interferon-Î³ gene expression signature.

Conclusion: Pembrolizumab demonstrated significant antitumor activity with durable responses and a favorable safety profile in patients with advanced MF/SS.",1/1/2020,"[{'Author': 'Michael S.

This study compared the safety and efficacy of RE and sorafenib in patients with locally advanced HCC.

Patients and Methods: SIRveNIB (selective internal radiation therapy v sorafenib), an open-label, investigator-initiated, phase III trial, compared yttrium-90 (90Y) resin microspheres RE with sorafenib 800 mg/d in patients with locally advanced HCC in a two-tailed study designed for superiority/detriment. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 and stratified by center and presence of portal vein thrombosis. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Efficacy analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses in the treated population.

Results: A total of 360 patients were randomly assigned (RE, 182; sorafenib, 178) from 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In the RE and sorafenib groups, 28.6% and 9.0%, respectively, failed to receive assigned therapy without significant cross-over to either group. Median OS was 8.8 and 10.0 months with RE and sorafenib, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.4; P = .36). A total of 1,468 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported (RE, 437; sorafenib, 1,031). Significantly fewer patients in the RE than sorafenib group had grade Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 AEs (36 of 130 [27.7%]) v 82 of 162 [50.6%]; P < .001). The most common grade Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 AEs were ascites (five of 130 [3.8%] v four of 162 [2.5%] patients), abdominal pain (three [2.3%] v two [1.2%] patients), anemia (zero v four [2.5%] patients), and radiation hepatitis (two [1.5%] v zero [0%] patients). Fewer patients in the RE group (27 of 130 [20.8%]) than in the sorafenib group (57 of 162 [35.2%]) had serious AEs.

Conclusion: In patients with locally advanced HCC, OS did not differ significantly between RE and sorafenib.

Prevention of Delayed Nausea: A University of Rochester Cancer Center Community Clinical Oncology Program Study of Patients Receiving Chemotherapy,Joseph A. Roscoe; Charles E. Heckler; Gary R. Morrow; Supriya G. Mohile; Shaker R. Dakhil; James L. Wade; J. Philip Kuebler,"Purpose: We conducted a double-blind randomized clinical trial of the following four regimens for controlling delayed nausea (DN): group 1: palonosetron + dexamethasone on day 1 with prochlorperazine on days 2 and 3; group 2: granisetron + dexamethasone on day 1 with prochlorperazine on days 2 and 3; group 3: aprepitant + palonosetron + dexamethasone on day 1 with aprepitant + dexamethasone on days 2 and 3; and group 4: palonosetron + dexamethasone on day 1 with prochlorperazine + dexamethasone on days 2 and 3.

Patients and Methods: Chemotherapy-naive patients received doxorubicin, epirubicin, cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin. The primary end point was average nausea assessed four times daily on days 2 and 3. Primary analyses were whether nausea control would be improved by using palonosetron versus granisetron on day 1 (group 1 v group 2); by adding dexamethasone on days 2 and 3 (group 1 v group 4); and by using aprepitant versus prochlorperazine (group 3 v group 4). Statistical significance was set at P = .017.

Results: Two hundred thirty-four, 234, 241, and 235 evaluable patients were accrued to groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Adjusted mean differences for the three planned analyses were as follows: palonosetron versus granisetron: âˆ’0.01 (95% CI, âˆ’0.23 to 0.20; P = .72); adding dexamethasone on days 2 and 3: 0.20 (95% CI, âˆ’0.02 to 0.41; P = .01); and using aprepitant versus prochlorperazine: âˆ’0.03 (95% CI, âˆ’0.24 to 0.19; P = .56).

Conclusion: The addition of dexamethasone on days 2 and 3 reduced DN. Palonosetron and granisetron have similar effects on DN. The beneficial effect of adding aprepitant for control of DN was the same as adding prochlorperazine.",9/20/2012,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'Gary R.

Incorporating Bevacizumab and Erlotinib in the Combined-Modality Treatment of Stage III Nonâ€“Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Results of a Phase I/II Trial,Mark A. Socinski; Thomas E. Stinchcombe; Dominic T. Moore; Scott N. Gettinger; Roy H. Decker; W. Jeffrey Petty; A. William Blackstock; Garry Schwartz; Scott Lankford; Amir Khandani; David E. Morris,"Purpose: Bevacizumab and erlotinib have been shown to improve survival in stage IV nonâ€“small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This phase I/II trial was designed to incorporate these agents with induction and concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC.

Patients and Methods: Patients received induction chemotherapy (carboplatin area under the curve [AUC] 6, paclitaxel 225 mg/m2, and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on days 1 and 22) followed by concurrent chemotherapy (carboplatin AUC 2 and paclitaxel 45 mg/m2 weekly with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every other week for four doses) and thoracic conformal radiation therapy (TCRT) to 74 Gy. In the phase I portion, cohort 1 received no erlotinib, whereas cohorts 2 and 3 received erlotinib at 100 and 150 mg, respectively, Tuesday through Friday, during TCRT. Consolidation therapy with erlotinib (150 mg daily) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) was planned 3 to 6 weeks later for six cycles.

Results: Forty-five eligible patients were enrolled. The objective response rates to induction and overall treatment were 39% (95% CI, 24% to 55%) and 60% (95% CI, 44% to 75%), respectively. The median progression-free and overall survival times were 10.2 months (95% CI, 8.4 to 18.3 months) and 18.4 months (95% CI, 13.4 to 31.7 months), respectively. The principal toxicity was esophagitis (29% grade 3 or 4 esophagitis, with one patient with grade 3 tracheoesophageal fistula), which was often prolonged.

However, FLT3 mutations are a common mechanism of resistance to this regimen. The addition of gilteritinib, an oral FLT3 inhibitor, to azacitidine and venetoclax may improve outcomes in patients with FLT3-mutated AML.

Methods: This phase I/II study evaluated azacitidine, venetoclax, and gilteritinib in two cohorts: patients with (1) newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML who were unfit for intensive chemotherapy or (2) relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutated AML (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04140487). The primary end points were the maximum tolerated dose of gilteritinib (phase I) and the combined complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) rate (phase II).

Results: Fifty-two patients were enrolled (frontline [n = 30]; relapsed/refractory [n = 22]). The recommended phase II dose was gilteritinib 80 mg once daily in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax. In the frontline cohort, the median age was 71 years and 73% of patients had an FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation. The CR/CRi rate was 96% (CR, 90%; CRi, 6%). Sixty-five percent of evaluable patients achieved FLT3-ITD measurable residual disease <5 Ã— 10â€“5 within four cycles. With a median follow-up of 19.3 months, the median relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) have not been reached and the 18-month RFS and OS rates are 71% and 72%, respectively. In the relapsed/refractory cohort, the CR/CRi rate was 27%; nine additional patients (41%) achieved a morphologic leukemiaâ€“free state. The most common grade 3 or higher nonhematologic adverse events were infection (62%) and febrile neutropenia (38%), which were more frequent in the relapsed/refractory cohort.

Conclusion: The combination of azacitidine, venetoclax, and gilteritinib resulted in high rates of CR/CRi, deep FLT3 molecular responses, and encouraging survival in newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML. Myelosuppression was manageable with mitigative dosing strategies.",5/1/2024,"[{'Author': 'Nicholas J.

Phase I Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Study of Oral Sapacitabine in Patients With Acute Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome,Hagop Kantarjian; Guillermo Garcia-Manero; Susan O'Brien; Stefan Faderl; Farhad Ravandi; Robert Westwood; Simon R. Green; Judy H. Chiao; Patricia A. Boone; Jorge Cortes; William Plunkett,"Purpose: Sapacitabine is an oral deoxycytidine nucleoside analog with a unique mechanism of action that is different from cytarabine.

Patients and Methods: To define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of sapacitabine given orally twice daily for 7 days every 3 to 4 weeks, or twice daily for 3 days for 2 weeks (days 1 through 3 and days 8 through 10) every 3 to 4 weeks, in refractory-relapse acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A total of 47 patients were treated in the phase I study that used a classical 3 + 3 design. Sapacitabine was escalated from 75 to 375 mg twice daily for 7 days (n = 35) and from 375 to 475 mg twice daily for 3 days on days 1 through 3 and days 8 through 10.

Results: The DLTs with both schedules were gastrointestinal. The MTDs were 375 mg twice daily for 7 days and 425 mg twice daily for 3 days on days 1 through 3 and days 8 through 10. The recommended phase II single-agent dose schedules were 325 mg twice daily for 7 days and 425 mg twice daily for 3 days on days 1 through 3 and days 8 through 10.

Price,"Purpose: To determine whether adding bevacizumab, with or without mitomycin, to capecitabine monotherapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in an open-label, three-arm randomized trial.

Patients and Methods: Overall, 471 patients in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom with previously untreated, unresectable mCRC were randomly assigned to the following: capecitabine; capecitabine plus bevacizumab (CB); or capecitabine, bevacizumab, and mitomycin (CBM). We compared CB with capecitabine and CBM with capecitabine for progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), toxicity, response rate (RR), and quality of life (QOL).

Results: Median PFS was 5.7 months for capecitabine, 8.5 months for CB, and 8.4 months for CBM (capecitabine v CB: hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.79; P < .001; C v CBM: HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.75; P < .001). After a median follow-up of 31 months, median OS was 18.9 months for capecitabine and was 16.4 months for CBM; these data were not significantly different. Toxicity rates were acceptable, and all treatment regimens well tolerated. Bevacizumab toxicities were similar to those in previous studies. Measures of overall QOL were similar in all groups.

Lara Jr,"Purpose: Patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma are often ineligible for cisplatin-based treatments. A National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Programâ€“sponsored trial assessed the tolerability and efficacy of a gemcitabine-eribulin combination in this population.

Methods: Patients with treatment-naÃ¯ve advanced or recurrent metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, ureter, or urethra not amenable to curative surgery and not candidates for cisplatin-based therapy were eligible. Cisplatin ineligibility was defined as creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min (but â‰¥ 30 mL/min), grade 2 neuropathy, or grade 2 hearing loss. Treatment was gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 intravenously followed by eribulin 1.4 mg/m2, both on days 1 and 8, repeated in 21-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicity. A Simon two-stage phase II trial design was used to distinguish between Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 objective response rates of 20% versus 50%.

Results: Between June 2015 and March 2017, 24 eligible patients with a median age of 73 years (range, 62 to 88 years) underwent therapy. Performance status of 0, 1, or 2 was seen in 11, 11, and two patients, respectively. Sites of disease included: lymph nodes, 16; lungs, nine; liver, seven; bladder, five; bones, two. Median number of cycles received was four (range, one to 16). Of 24 patients, 12 were confirmed responders; the observed objective response rate was 50% (95% CI, 29% to 71%). Median overall survival was 11.9 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 20.4 months), and median progression-free survival was 5.3 months (95% CI, 4.5 to 6.7 months). The most common treatment-related any-grade toxicities were fatigue (83% of patients), neutropenia (79%), anemia (63%), alopecia (50%), elevated AST (50%), and constipation, nausea, and thrombocytopenia (42% each).

Patients and Methods: Patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC (no prior systemic therapy for advanced disease) were randomly assigned 1:1 to carboplatin (area under the curve, 6 mg/ml Â· min) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) intravenously for up to six 3-week cycles plus either motesanib 125 mg (arm A) or placebo (arm B) once daily orally. OS was the primary end point. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), adverse events (AEs), and association between placental growth factor (PLGF) change and OS.

Results: A total of 1,090 patients with nonsquamous NSCLC were randomly assigned (arms A/B, n = 541 of 549); of those, 890 had adenocarcinoma (n = 448 of 442). Median OS in arms A and B was 13.0 and 11.0 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.04; P = .14); median OS for the adenocarcinoma subset was 13.5 and 11.0 months, respectively (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.03; P = .11). In descriptive analyses (arms A v B), median PFS was 5.6 months versus 5.4 months (P = < .001); ORR was 40% versus 26% (P < .001). There was no association between PLGF change and OS in arm A. The incidence of grade â‰¥ 3 AEs (arms A and B, 73% and 59%, respectively) and grade 5 AEs (14% and 9%, respectively) was higher with motesanib treatment.

Motzer,"Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib plus nivolumab in a phase II trial in patients with nonâ€“clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Patients and Methods: Patients had advanced nonâ€“clear-cell renal carcinoma who underwent 0-1 prior systemic therapies excluding prior immune checkpoint inhibitors. Patients received cabozantinib 40 mg once daily plus nivolumab 240 mg once every 2 weeks or 480 mg once every 4 weeks. Cohort 1 enrolled patients with papillary, unclassified, or translocation-associated RCC; cohort 2 enrolled patients with chromophobe RCC. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1; secondary end points included progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Next-generation sequencing results were correlated with response.

Results: A total of 47 patients were treated with a median follow-up of 13.1 months. Objective response rate for cohort 1 (n = 40) was 47.5% (95% CI, 31.5 to 63.9), with median progression-free survival of 12.5 months (95% CI, 6.3 to 16.4) and median overall survival of 28 months (95% CI, 16.3 to not evaluable). In cohort 2 (n = 7), no responses were observed; one patient had stable disease > 1 year. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 32% treated patients. Cabozantinib and nivolumab were discontinued because of toxicity in 13% and 17% of patients, respectively. Common mutations included NF2 and FH in cohort 1 and TP53 and PTEN in cohort 2. Objective responses were seen in 10/12 patients with either NF2 or FH mutations.

Conclusion: Cabozantinib plus nivolumab showed promising efficacy in most nonâ€“clear-cell RCC variants tested in this trial, particularly those with prominent papillary features, whereas treatment effects were limited in chromophobe RCC.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

Final overall survival (OS) in SOPHIA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02492711), a study of margetuximab versus trastuzumab, both with chemotherapy, in patients with previously treated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2â€“positive advanced breast cancer, is reported with updated safety. Overall, 536 patients in the intention-to-treat population were randomly assigned to margetuximab (15 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks; n = 266) plus chemotherapy or trastuzumab (6 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks after a loading dose of 8 mg/kg; n = 270) plus chemotherapy. Primary end points were progression-free survival, previously reported, and OS. Final OS analysis was triggered by 385 prespecified events. The median OS was 21.6 months (95% CI, 18.89 to 25.07) with margetuximab versus 21.9 months (95% CI, 18.69 to 24.18) with trastuzumab (hazard ratio [HR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.17; P = .620). Preplanned, exploratory analysis of CD16A genotyping suggested a possible improvement in OS for margetuximab in CD16A-158FF patients versus trastuzumab (median OS, 23.6 v 19.2 months; HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.00) and a possible improvement in OS for trastuzumab in CD16A-158VV patients versus margetuximab (median OS, 31.1 v 22.0 months; HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.01 to 3.12). Margetuximab safety was comparable with trastuzumab. Final overall OS analysis did not demonstrate margetuximab advantage over trastuzumab. Margetuximab studies in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2â€“positive breast cancer with different CD16A allelic variants are warranted.",1/10/2023,"[{'Author': 'Timothy J.

Tailored Immunotherapy Approach With Nivolumab in Advanced Transitional Cell Carcinoma,Marc-Oliver  Grimm; Bernd JÃ¼rgen  Schmitz-DrÃ¤ger; Uwe  Zimmermann; Christine Barbara  GrÃ¼n; Gustavo Bruno  Baretton; Marc  Schmitz; Susan  Foller; Katharina  Leucht; Martin  Schostak; Friedemann  Zengerling; Ulrike  Schumacher; Wolfgang  Loidl; Johannes  Meran,"Purpose: Several antiâ€“programmed cell death (ligand)-1 (PD-[L]1) immune checkpoint inhibitors are approved in advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). Recently, improved activity of an antiâ€“PD-1/anticytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 (CTLA-4) combination versus antiâ€“PD-1 monotherapy has been reported. We report a response-based approach starting treatment with nivolumab monotherapy with nivolumab/ipilimumab as immunotherapeutic boost.

Methods: After four doses of nivolumab induction, responders continued with nivolumab maintenance therapy. Patients with stable/progressive disease received nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 2 doses followed by nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 2 doses, if not responding to the initial boost. Responders to boosts continued with nivolumab maintenance. Between July 2017 and April 2019, 86 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up is 7.7 months. The primary end point is objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST1.1. Secondary end points include efficacy of nivolumab induction, remission rate with nivolumab/ipilimumab boosts, overall survival, and safety.

Results: Of all patients, 42, 39, and five were first- (1L), second- (2L), and third-line (3L), respectively. The median age was 68 years. The ORR with nivolumab monotherapy (assessed at week 8) was 29% in 1L and 23% in 2/3L, respectively. Forty-one patients received early (week 8) and 11 received later nivolumab/ipilimumab boosts. ORRs with nivolumab with or without nivolumab/ipilimumab (best overall response) were 45% and 27% in 1L and 2/3L, respectively. In 1L, 7 of 17 patients receiving boosts at week 8 improved, compared with 2 of 24 in 2/3L.

Conclusion: The tailored approach of TITAN-TCC shows meaningful clinical activity supporting dual checkpoint inhibition in 1L mUC. However, starting therapy with nivolumab exclusively appears inadequate given the aggressive nature of mUC. In 2/3L, nivolumab/ipilimumab boosts with escalating ipilimumab dose did not improve efficacy outcomes versus nivolumab monotherapy. An independent 2L cohort of TITAN-TCC receiving nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 4 doses is ongoing.",7/1/2022,"[{'Author': 'Marc-Oliver Grimm', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Astellas Pharma, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, MSD, Pfizer, Ipsen, Merck Serono, EUSA Pharma', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Ipsen, MSD, Pfizer, Astellas Pharma, EUSA Pharma, Merck Serono, Roche Pharma AG, Takeda, Eisai, Bayer/Vital', 'Research Funding: Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Intuitive Surgical (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Serono']}, {'Author': 'Bernd JÃ¼rgen Schmitz-DrÃ¤ger', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Hexal, Astellas Pharma, Janssen Oncology, Bayer Health, Atheneum', 'Research Funding: Cepheid/Danaher (Inst), Nucleix (Inst), Concile (Inst), Arquer Diagnostics (Inst), Nextage (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Gustavo Bruno Baretton', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: MSD/AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer, Roche', 'Research Funding: BMS (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: BMS']}, {'Author': 'Susan Foller', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Roche Pharma AG, MSD, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, Pfizer, Ipsen, PROCEPT BioRobotics', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, MSD, Ipsen, Merck/Pfizer']}, {'Author': 'Katharina Leucht', 'Disclosures': ['Other Relationship: Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Martin Schostak', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Bayer, Merck, AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Janssen Oncology, Pfizer', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: MSD Oncology, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer, Ipsen, EDAP TMS, Sanofi, Janssen Oncology, Astellas Pharma', 'Research Funding: Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Ipsen (Inst), MSD Oncology (Inst), Janssen Oncology (Inst), Sanofi (Inst), Bayer (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: AstraZeneca, MSD Oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer, Sanofi, Merck, EDAP TMS, Pfizer, Bayer']}, {'Author': 'Friedemann Zengerling', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Ipsen, Pfizer, Merck Serono, Astellas Pharma, Janssen', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi/Aventis, Merck Serono, IPSEN, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Bayer Health, Apogepha, Pfizer, Janssen, Roche']}, {'Author': 'Wolfgang Loidl', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche Pharma AG, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bristol Myers Squibb, Janssen Oncology']}, {'Author': 'Johannes Meran', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: MSD, Astellas Pharma', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]",nivolumab,Bristol Myers Squibb,1,1,

Methods: Patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) MCL after â‰¥two lines of previous therapy, including a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), an alkylating agent, and a CD20-targeted agent, received lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) at a target dose level (DL) of 50 Ã— 106 (DL1) or 100 Ã— 106 (DL2) chimeric antigen receptor-positive T cells. Primary end points were adverse events (AEs), dose-limiting toxicities, and objective response rate (ORR) by independent review committee per Lugano criteria.

Results: Of 104 leukapheresed patients, liso-cel was infused into 88. Median (range) number of previous lines of therapy was three (1-11) with 30% receiving â‰¥five previous lines of therapy, 73% of patients were age 65 years and older, 69% had refractory disease, 53% had BTKi refractory disease, 23% had TP53 mutation, and 8% had secondary CNS lymphoma. Median (range) on-study follow-up was 16.1 months (0.4-60.5). In the efficacy set (n = 83; DL1 + DL2), ORR was 83.1% (95% CI, 73.3 to 90.5) and complete response (CR) rate was 72.3% (95% CI, 61.4 to 81.6). Median duration of response was 15.7 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 24.0) and progression-free survival was 15.3 months (95% CI, 6.6 to 24.9). Most common grade â‰¥3 treatment-emergent AEs were neutropenia (56%), anemia (37.5%), and thrombocytopenia (25%). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported in 61% of patients (grade 3/4, 1%; grade 5, 0), neurologic events (NEs) in 31% (grade 3/4, 9%; grade 5, 0), grade â‰¥3 infections in 15%, and prolonged cytopenia in 40%.

Two-Year Randomized Controlled Prospective Trial Converting Treatment of Stable Renal Transplant Recipients With Cutaneous Invasive Squamous Cell Carcinomas to Sirolimus,Judith M. Hoogendijk-van den Akker; Paul N. Harden; Andries J. Hoitsma; Charlotte M. Proby; Ron Wolterbeek; Jan Nico Bouwes Bavinck; Johan W. de Fijter,"Purpose: In light of the significant morbidity and mortality of cutaneous invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) in renal transplant recipients, we investigated whether conversion to sirolimus-based immunosuppression from standard immunosuppression could diminish the recurrence rate of these skin cancers.

Patients and Methods: In a 2-year randomized controlled trial, 155 renal transplant recipients with at least one biopsy-confirmed SCC were stratified according to age (< 55 v â‰¥ 55 years) and number of previous SCCs (one to nine v â‰¥ 10) and randomly assigned to conversion to sirolimus (n = 74) or continuation of their original immunosuppression (n = 81). Development of a new SCC within 2 years after random assignment was the primary end point.

Results: After 2 years of follow-up, the risk reduction of new SCCs in the multivariable analysis was not significant, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.48 to 1.2; P = .255), compared with a nonâ€“sirolimus-based regimen. After the first year, there was a significant 50% risk reduction, with an HR of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.28 to 0.90; P = .021) for all patients together and an HR of 0.11 (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.94; P = .044) for patients with only one previous SCC. The tumor burden of SCC was reduced during the 2-year follow-up period in those receiving sirolimus (0.82 v 1.38 per year; HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.82; P = .006) if adjusted for the number of previous SCCs and age. Twenty-nine patients stopped taking sirolimus because of various adverse events.

Conclusion: Conversion to sirolimus-based immunosuppression failed to show a benefit in terms of SCC-free survival at 2 years.",4/1/2013,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Stock Ownership:']}, {'Author': 'Paul N.

Symptom Control and Quality of Life in LUX-Lung 3: A Phase III Study of Afatinib or Cisplatin/Pemetrexed in Patients With Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma With EGFR Mutations,James Chih-Hsin Yang; Vera Hirsh; Martin Schuler; Nobuyuki Yamamoto; Kenneth J. O'Byrne; Tony S.K. Mok; Victoria Zazulina; Mehdi Shahidi; Juliane Lungershausen; Dan Massey; Michael Palmer; Lecia V. Sequist,"Purpose: Patient-reported symptoms and health-related quality of life (QoL) benefits were investigated in a randomized, phase III trial of afatinib or cisplatin/pemetrexed.

Patients and Methods: Three hundred forty-five patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutationâ€“positive lung adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned 2:1 to afatinib 40 mg per day or up to six cycles of cisplatin/pemetrexed. Lung cancer symptoms and health-related QoL were assessed every 21 days until progression using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and Lung Cancer-13 questionnaires. Analyses of cough, dyspnea, and pain were preplanned, including percentage of patients who improved on therapy, time to deterioration of symptoms, and change in symptoms over time.

Results: Questionnaire compliance was high. Compared with chemotherapy, afatinib significantly delayed the time to deterioration for cough (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.87; P = .007) and dyspnea (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.93; P = .015), but not pain (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.10; P = .19). More patients on afatinib (64%) versus chemotherapy (50%) experienced improvements in dyspnea scores (P = .010). Differences in mean scores over time significantly favored afatinib over chemotherapy for cough (P < .001) and dyspnea (P < .001). Afatinib showed significantly better mean scores over time in global health status/QoL (P = .015) and physical (P < .001), role (P = .004), and cognitive (P = .007) functioning compared with chemotherapy. Fatigue and nausea were worse with chemotherapy, whereas diarrhea, dysphagia, and sore mouth were worse with afatinib (all P < .01).

Conclusion: In patients with lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations, first-line afatinib was associated with better control of cough and dyspnea compared with chemotherapy, although diarrhea, dysphagia, and sore mouth were worse. Global health status/QoL was also improved over time with afatinib compared with chemotherapy.",9/20/2013,"[{'Author': 'Victoria Zazulina', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: Boehringer Ingelheim']}, {'Author': 'Mehdi Shahidi', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: Boehringer Ingelheim']}, {'Author': 'Juliane Lungershausen', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: Boehringer Ingelheim']}, {'Author': 'Dan Massey', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: Boehringer Ingelheim']}, {'Author': 'James Chih-Hsin Yang', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role: Boehringer Ingelheim (U), Eli Lilly (U), Novartis , Roche , AstraZeneca , Pfizer , Takeda Pharmaceuticals , Clovis Oncology , TTY Biopharm , Innopharma , MSD , Merck , Genentech']}, {'Author': 'Vera Hirsh', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role: Boehringer Ingelheim']}, {'Author': ""Kenneth J.

Prevention of Aromatase Inhibitorâ€“Induced Bone Loss Using Risedronate: The SABRE Trial,Catherine Van Poznak; Rosemary A. Hannon; John R. Mackey; Mario Campone; Justus P. Apffelstaedt; Glen Clack; David Barlow; Andreas Makris; Richard Eastell,"Purpose: To investigate the management of bone health in women with early breast cancer (EBC) who were scheduled to receive anastrozole.

Patients and Methods: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptorâ€“positive EBC were assigned to one of three strata by risk of fragility fracture. Patients with the highest risk (H) received anastrozole 1 mg/d plus risedronate 35 mg/wk orally. Patients with moderate-risk (M) were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to anastrozole and risedronate (A + R) or to anastrozole and placebo (A + P). Patients with lower-risk (L) received anastrozole (A) alone. Calcium and vitamin D were recommended for all patients. Lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) were assessed at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months.

Results: At 24 months, in the M group, treatment with A + R resulted in a significant increase in lumbar spine and total hip BMD compared with A + P treatment (2.2% v âˆ’1.8%; treatment ratio, 1.04; P < .0001; and 1.8% v âˆ’1.1%; treatment ratio, 1.03; P < .0001, respectively). In the H stratum, lumbar spine and total hip BMD increased significantly (3.0%; P = .0006; and 2.0%; P = .0104, respectively). Patients in the L stratum showed a significant decrease in lumbar spine BMD (âˆ’2.1%; P = .0109) and a numerical decrease in total hip BMD (âˆ’0.4%; P = .5988). Safety profiles for anastrozole and risedronate were similar to those already established.

Conclusion: In postmenopausal women at risk of fragility fracture who were receiving adjuvant anastrozole for EBC, the addition of risedronate at doses established for preventing and treating osteoporosis resulted in favorable effects in BMD during 24 months.",2/20/2010,"[{'Author': 'Glen Clack', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: AstraZeneca']}, {'Author': 'Catherine Van Poznak', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca , Novartis , Roche , Amgen']}, {'Author': 'David Barlow', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca']}, {'Author': 'Andreas Makris', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca']}, {'Author': 'Richard Eastell', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca , Sanofi Aventis']}, {'Author': 'Glen Clack', 'Disclosures': ['Stock Ownership: AstraZeneca']}, {'Author': 'Rosemary A.

Moore,"Purpose: This phase Ib study evaluated the safety and efficacy of paclitaxel plus navicixizumab, a bispecific antiangiogenic antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor and delta-like ligand 4, against platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

Patients and Methods: This open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation and -expansion study included 44 patients with previously treated, recurrent, platinum-resistant grade 2/3 ovarian cancer. Treatment was intravenous navicixizumab (3 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg once every 2 weeks) plus paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 intravenously on days 0, 7, and 14 of 28-day cycles). The primary and secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of navicixizumab plus paclitaxel. An RNA-based diagnostic panel was retrospectively used to test the hypothesis that tumors with high angiogenesis or immune-suppressed tumor microenvironment (TME) subtypes (biomarker-positive) are more likely to respond to navicixizumab than those with immune-active/-desert TME subtypes (biomarker-negative). RNA expression was analyzed in available pretreatment tumor tissue to classify 33 patients' TME subtypes, and TME panel findings were correlated with tumor response.

Results: The dose-escalation cohorts enrolled patients at navicixizumab doses of 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (n = 3) and 4 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (n = 2); 3 mg/kg was selected for expansion (n = 39). No dose-limiting toxicities occurred. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were hypertension (40.9%), neutropenia (6.8%), and thrombocytopenia (4.5%). Pulmonary hypertension occurred in 18.2% (grade 1-2). The overall objective response rate was 43.2% (95% CI, 28.3 to 59.0): 33.3% (95% CI, 17.3 to 52.8) in patients previously treated with bevacizumab, 64.3% (95% CI, 35.1 to 87.2) in bevacizumab-naive patients, and 62% (95% CI, 31.6 to 86.1) in biomarker-positive patients. The median duration of response was 6 months (95% CI, 5.4 months to not estimable).

Conclusion: Navicixizumab plus paclitaxel demonstrated promising clinical activity in bevacizumab-treated and -naive patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, with manageable toxicity.",8/10/2022,"[{'Author': 'Siqing Fu', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Novartis (Inst), NeuPharma Inc (Inst), BeiGene (Inst), MacroGenics (Inst), BioAtla (Inst), Parexel International LLC (Inst), Boehringer Ingelheim (Inst), Abbisko (Inst), Lilly (Inst), Hookipa Pharma (Inst), IMV (Inst), Innovent Biologics (Inst), Lyvgen Biopharma (Inst), Millennium (Inst), Nerviano Medical Sciences (Inst), NIH/NCI (Inst), Sellas Life Sciences (Inst), Soricimed (Inst), NovoCure (Inst), Turnstone Bio (Inst), Taiho Oncology (Inst), NCCN (Inst), Exelis (Inst), Green2Bio, Inc (Inst), K-Group Beta (Inst), NextCure (Inst), Ningbo NewBay Medical Technology (Inst), PureTech Health LLC (Inst), SQZ Biotech (Inst), Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Oncology (Inst), Treadwell Therapeutics (Inst), Tyligand Bioscience Ltd (Inst), Vaccibody (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Bradley R.

Improved Outcome in Pediatric Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Results of a Randomized Trial on Liposomal Daunorubicin by the International BFM Study Group,Gertjan J.L.

Tamminga; Olga Aleinikova; Hortensia Armendariz; Michael Dworzak; Shau-Yin Ha; Henrik Hasle; Liisa Hovi; Alexei Maschan; Yves Bertrand; Guy G. Leverger; Bassem I. Razzouk; Carmelo Rizzari; Petr Smisek; Owen Smith; Batia Stark; Ursula Creutzig,"Purpose: In pediatric relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), optimal reinduction therapy is unknown. Studies suggest that liposomal daunorubicin (DNX; DaunoXome; Galen, Craigavon, United Kingdom) is effective and less cardiotoxic, which is important in this setting. These considerations led to a randomized phase III study by the International Berlin-Frankfurt-MÃ¼nster Study Group.

Patients and Methods: Patients with relapsed or primary refractory nonâ€“French-American-British type M3 AML who were younger than 21 years of age were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG) or to FLAG plus DNX in the first reinduction course. The primary end point was status of the bone marrow (BM) sampled shortly before the second course of chemotherapy (the day 28 BM). Data are presented according to intention-to-treat for all 394 randomly assigned patients (median follow-up, 4.0 years).

Results: The complete remission (CR) rate was 64%, and the 4-year probability of survival (pOS) was 38% (SE, 3%). The day 28 BM status (available in 359 patients) was good (â‰¤ 20% leukemic blasts) in 80% of patients randomly assigned to FLAG/DNX and 70% for patients randomly assigned to FLAG (P = .04). Concerning secondary end points, the CR rate was 69% with FLAG/DNX and 59% with FLAG (P = .07), but overall survival was similar. However, core-binding factor (CBF) AML treated with FLAG/DNX resulted in pOS of 82% versus 58% with FLAG (P = .04). Grade 3 to 4 toxicity was essentially similar in both groups.

Conclusion: DNX added to FLAG improves early treatment response in pediatric relapsed AML. Overall long-term survival was similar, but CBF-AML showed an improved survival with FLAG/DNX. International collaboration proved feasible and resulted in the best outcome for pediatric relapsed AML reported thus far.",2/10/2013,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'Gertjan J.L.

Association Between Circulating Tumor Cells and Prognosis in Patients With Stage III Melanoma With Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in a Phase III International Multicenter Trial,Sojun Hoshimoto; Tatsushi Shingai; Donald L. Morton; Christine Kuo; Mark B. Faries; Kelly Chong; David Elashoff; He-Jing Wang; Robert M. Elashoff; Dave S.B. Hoon,"Purpose: The outcomes of patients with melanoma who have sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases can be highly variable, which has precluded establishment of consensus regarding treatment of the group. The detection of high-risk patients from this clinical setting may be helpful for determination of both prognosis and management. We report the utility of multimarker reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with melanoma diagnosed with SLN metastases in a phase III, international, multicenter clinical trial.

Patients and Methods: Blood specimens were collected from patients with melanoma (n = 331) who were clinically disease-free after complete lymphadenectomy (CLND) before entering onto a randomized adjuvant melanoma vaccine plus bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) versus BCG placebo trial from 30 melanoma centers (United States and international). Blood was assessed using a verified multimarker RT-qPCR assay (MART-1, MAGE-A3, and GalNAc-T) of melanoma-associated proteins. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of CTC status for disease recurrence and melanoma-specific survival (MSS).

Results: Individual CTC biomarker detection ranged from 13.4% to 17.5%. There was no association of CTC status (zero to one positive biomarkers v two or more positive biomarkers) with known clinical or pathologic prognostic variables. However, two or more positive biomarkers was significantly associated with worse distant metastasis disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.13, P = .009) and reduced recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.70, P = .046) and MSS (HR = 1.88, P = .043) in a multivariable analysis.

Conclusion: CTC biomarker status is a prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis disease-free survival, and MSS after CLND in patients with SLN metastasis. This multimarker RT-qPCR analysis may therefore be useful in discriminating patients who may benefit from aggressive adjuvant therapy or stratifying patients for adjuvant clinical trials.",11/1/2012,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Stock Ownership:']}, {'Author': 'Dave S.B.

Abramson; Mark D.  Krailo; Carlos  Rodriguez-Galindo; Murali M.  Chintagumpala,"Purpose: Metastatic retinoblastoma has a poor prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT). Intensified therapy may improve the outcome.

Methods: A prospective, international trial enrolled patients with extraocular retinoblastoma. Patients with stage II or III (locoregional) retinoblastoma received four cycles of chemotherapy, followed by involved field RT (45 Gy). Patients with stage IVa or IVb (metastatic or trilateral) retinoblastoma also received four cycles of chemotherapy and those with â‰¥ partial response then received one cycle of high-dose carboplatin, thiotepa, and etoposide with autologous hematopoietic stem-cell support. Patients with stage IVa or IVb with residual tumor postchemotherapy received RT. The proportion of patients who achieved event-free survival would be reported and compared with historical controls separately for each of the three groups of patients.

Results: Fifty-seven eligible patients were included in the analyses. Event-free survival at 1 year was 88.1% (90% CI, 66.6 to 96.2) for stage II-III, 82.6% (90% CI, 61.0 to 92.9) for stage IVa, and 28.3% (90% CI, 12.7 to 46.2) for stage IVb/trilateral. Toxicity was significant as expected and included two therapy-related deaths.

Conclusion: Intensive multimodality therapy is highly effective for patients with regional extraocular retinoblastoma and stage IVa metastatic retinoblastoma. Although the study met its aim for stage IVb, more effective therapy is still required for patients with CNS involvement (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00554788).",11/20/2022,"[{'Author': 'Ira J.

Johnson; Andrew  Davies; Emanuele  Zucca; on behalf of the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG),"Purpose: The role of consolidation radiotherapy in patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is controversial.

Methods: The IELSG37 trial, a randomized noninferiority study, aimed to assess whether irradiation can be omitted in patients with PMBCL with complete metabolic response (CMR) after induction immunochemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 30 months after random assignment. Patients with CMR were randomly assigned to observation or consolidation radiotherapy (30 Gy). With a noninferiority margin of 10% (assuming a 30-month PFS of 85% in both arms), a sample size of 540 patients was planned with 376 expected to be randomly assigned.

Results: The observed events were considerably lower than expected; therefore, primary end point analysis was conducted when â‰¥95% of patients were followed for â‰¥30 months. Of the 545 patients enrolled, 268 were in CMR after induction and were randomly assigned to observation (n = 132) or radiotherapy (n = 136). The 30-month PFS was 96.2% in the observation arm and 98.5% in the radiotherapy arm, with a stratified hazard ratio of 1.47 (95% CI, 0.34 to 6.28) and absolute risk difference of 0.68% (95% CI, â€“0.97 to 7.46). The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 99% in both arms. Nonrandomized patients were managed according to local policies. Radiotherapy was the only treatment in 86% of those with Deauville score (DS) 4 and in 57% of those with DS 5. The 5-year PFS and OS of patients with DS 4 (95.8% and 97.5%, respectively) were not significantly different from those of randomly assigned patients. Patients with DS5 had significantly poorer 5-year PFS and OS (60.3% and 74.6%, respectively).

Conclusion: This study, the largest randomized trial of radiotherapy in PMBCL, demonstrated favorable outcomes in patients achieving CMR with no survival impairment for those omitting irradiation.",12/1/2024,"[{'Author': 'Maurizio Martelli', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Gilead Sciences, Novartis, Abbvie, Incyte, BeiGene, Takeda, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene']}, {'Author': 'Iryna Kriachok', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen, AstraZeneca, Abbvie, Takeda, Roche, Merck', ""Speakers' Bureau: AstraZeneca, Abbvie, Takeda, Roche"", 'Research Funding: Janssen, Bayer, Karyopharm Therapeutics, MSD, Acerta Pharma, Abbvie, Debiopharm Group, Acerta Pharma, Merck, Bayer, InnoCarePharm, Chromos Pharma, Pharmacyclics', 'Expert Testimony: Takeda, Janssen, AstraZeneca, Takeda', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Takeda, MSD, Abbvie, Roche']}, {'Author': 'Monica Balzarotti', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Lilly, Gilead Sciences, Abbvie, AstraZeneca', ""Speakers' Bureau: Roche, Lilly, Gilead Sciences, SOBI"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche, BeiGene Beijing']}, {'Author': 'Alessandra Tucci', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Kyowa Kirin International, MDS Foundation', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen, Takeda, Gentili, Sanofi', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: sandoz']}, {'Author': 'Vittorio Ruggero Zilioli', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Kite, a Gilead company, Roche, Takeda', ""Speakers' Bureau: Lilly, Janssen, Takeda"", 'Research Funding: Kite/Gilead (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, BeiGene, Roche']}, {'Author': 'Luca Arcaini', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Eusa Pharma, Novartis/Ipsen', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Janssen-Cilag, Incyte, EUSA Pharma, Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb, Kite/Gilead, ADC Therapeutics, Kite/Gilead, Novartis', ""Speakers' Bureau: EUSA Pharma, Novartis"", 'Research Funding: Gilead Sciences', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche, Celgene, Janssen-Cilag, Eusa Pharma']}, {'Author': 'Anna Dabrowska-Iwanicka', 'Disclosures': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Gilead Sciences, Abbvie']}, {'Author': 'AndrÃ©s J.M.

It is not known whether adding ipilimumab to pembrolizumab improves efficacy over pembrolizumab alone in this population.

Methods: In the randomized, double-blind, phase III KEYNOTE-598 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03302234), eligible patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS â‰¥ 50% and no sensitizing EGFR or ALK aberrations were randomly allocated 1:1 to ipilimumab 1 mg/kg or placebo every 6 weeks for up to 18 doses; all participants received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 35 doses. Primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival.

Results: Of the 568 participants, 284 were randomly allocated to each group. Median overall survival was 21.4 months for pembrolizumab-ipilimumab versus 21.9 months for pembrolizumab-placebo (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.37; P = .74). Median progression-free survival was 8.2 months for pembrolizumab-ipilimumab versus 8.4 months for pembrolizumab-placebo (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.30; P = .72). Grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 62.4% of pembrolizumab-ipilimumab recipients versus 50.2% of pembrolizumab-placebo recipients and led to death in 13.1% versus 7.5%. The external data and safety monitoring committee recommended that the study be stopped for futility and that participants discontinue ipilimumab and placebo.

Conclusion: Adding ipilimumab to pembrolizumab does not improve efficacy and is associated with greater toxicity than pembrolizumab monotherapy as first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS â‰¥ 50% and no targetable EGFR or ALK aberrations.

McDonald; Cara  Mathews; Casey  Cosgrove; Summer  Dewdney; Carol  Aghajanian; Megan I.  Samuelson; Heather A.  Lankes; Robert A.  Soslow; Kimberly K.  Leslie,"Purpose: The status of p53 in a tumor can be inferred by next-generation sequencing (NGS) or by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We examined the association between p53 IHC and sequence and whether p53 IHC alone, or integrated with TP53 NGS, predicts the outcome.

Methods: From GOG-86P, a randomized phase II study of chemotherapy combined with either bevacizumab or temsirolimus in advanced endometrial cancer, 213 cases had p53 protein expression data measured by IHC and TP53 NGS data. An analysis was designed to integrate p53 expression by IHC with the presence or absence of a TP53 mutation. These variables were further correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab arms versus the chemotherapy plus temsirolimus arm.

Results: In the analysis of p53 IHC, the most striking treatment effect favoring bevacizumab was in cases where p53 was overexpressed (PFS hazard ratio [HR]: 0.46, 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.88; OS HR: 0.31, 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.62). On integrated analysis, patients with TP53 missense mutations and p53 protein overexpression had a similar treatment effect on PFS (HR: 0.41, 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.83) and OS (HR: 0.28, 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.59) favoring bevacizumab plus chemotherapy relative to temsirolimus plus chemotherapy. Concordance between TP53 NGS and p53 IHC was 88%. Concordance was 92% when cases with TP53 mutations and POLE mutations or mismatch repair deficiency were removed.

Conclusion: IHC for p53 alone or when integrated with sequencing for TP53 identifies a specific, high-risk tumor genotype/phenotype for which bevacizumab is particularly beneficial in improving outcomes when combined with chemotherapy.",10/1/2022,"[{'Author': 'Kristina W.

Based on excellent results with the chemotherapy-only regimen fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone (FCM), we built a new chemoimmunotherapy combinationâ€”rituximab plus FCM (R-FCM). We report a phase II clinical trial consisting of an initial treatment with R-FCM followed by rituximab maintenance.

Patients and Methods: Seventy-two untreated CLL patients age 70 years or younger received rituximab 500 mg/m2 on day 1 (375 mg/m2 the first cycle), fludarabine 25 mg/m2 IV on days 1 to 3, cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3, and mitoxantrone 6 mg/m2 IV on day 1, given at 4-week intervals with up to six cycles supported with colony-stimulating factor. Patients achieving response received maintenance with rituximab 375 mg/m2 every 3 months for 2 years.

Results: The overall response, minimal residual disease (MRD) â€“negative complete response (CR), MRD-positive CR, and partial response rates were 93%, 46%, 36%, and 11%, respectively. Severe neutropenia developed in 13% of patients. Major and minor infections were reported in 8% and 5% of cycles, respectively. Advanced clinical stage, del(17p), or increased serum Î²2-microglobulin levels correlated with a lower CR rate.

Conclusion: R-FCM is highly effective in previously untreated CLL, with an 82% CR rate and a high proportion of MRD-negative CRs (46%). Treatment toxicity is acceptable. Parameters correlating with a lower response rate were advanced clinical stage, high serum Î²2-microglobulin levels, and del(17p).

Materials and Methods: Patients with distal or middle-third, clinical primary tumor stage 3-4 and/or regional lymph nodeâ€“positive rectal cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) to short-term radiotherapy (25 Gy in five fractions over 1 week) followed by four cycles of chemotherapy (total neoadjuvant therapy [TNT]) or chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, concurrently with capecitabine [chemoradiotherapy; CRT]). Total mesorectal excision was undertaken 6-8 weeks after preoperative treatment, with two additional cycles of CAPOX (intravenous oxaliplatin [130 mg/m2, once a day] on day 1 and capecitabine [1,000 mg/m2, twice a day] from days 1 to 14) in the TNT group and six cycles of CAPOX in the CRT group. The primary end point was 3-year disease-free survival (DFS).

Results: Between August 2015 and August 2018, a total of 599 patients were randomly assigned to receive TNT (n = 302) or CRT (n = 297). At a median follow-up of 35.0 months, 3-year DFS was 64.5% and 62.3% in TNT and CRT groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.883; one-sided 95% CI, not applicable to 1.11; P < .001 for noninferiority). There was no significant difference in metastasis-free survival or locoregional recurrence, but the TNT group had better 3-year overall survival than the CRT group (86.5% v 75.1%; P = .033). Treatment effects on DFS and overall survival were similar regardless of prognostic factors. The prevalence of acute grade III-V toxicities during preoperative treatment was 26.5% in the TNT group versus 12.6% in the CRT group (P < .001).

Conclusion: Short-term radiotherapy with preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery was efficacious with acceptable toxicity and could be used as an alternative to CRT for locally advanced rectal cancer.",5/20/2022,"[{'Author': 'Chen Hu', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Merck Sharp & Dohme, D1 Medical Technology']}, {'Author': 'Ai-Ping Zhou', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Pfizer, Novartis', 'No other potential conflicts of interest were reported.']}]",capecitabine,,1,1,

Schilsky,"Purpose: The TAPUR Study is a phase II basket trial that aims to identify signals of antitumor activity of commercially available targeted agents in patients with advanced cancers harboring genomic alterations known to be drug targets. Results in a cohort of patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC) with high tumor mutational burden (HTMB) treated with pembrolizumab are reported.

Methods: Patients with advanced mBC received standard doses of either 2 mg/kg or 200 mg infusions of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. Simon's two-stage design was used with a primary study end point of disease control (DC) defined as objective response or stable disease of at least 16 weeks duration. If two or more patients in stage I achieved DC, the cohort would enroll 18 additional patients in stage II. Secondary end points include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and safety.

Results: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled from October 2016 to July 2018. All patients' tumors had HTMB ranging from 9 to 37 mutations/megabase. DC and objective response were noted in 37% (95% CI, 21 to 50) and 21% of patients (95% CI, 8 to 41), respectively. Median PFS was 10.6 weeks (95% CI, 7.7 to 21.1); median overall survival was 30.6 weeks (95% CI, 18.3 to 103.3). No relationship was observed between PFS and tumor mutational burden. Five patients experienced â‰¥ 1 serious adverse event or grade 3 adverse event at least possibly related to pembrolizumab consistent with the product label.

Conclusion: Pembrolizumab monotherapy has antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with mBC characterized by HTMB.

Phelps,"Purpose: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma-cell neoplasm for which most treatments involve a therapeutic agent combined with dexamethasone. The preclinical combination of lenalidomide with the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 has displayed synergy in vitro and represents a novel combination in MM.

Patients and Methods: A phase I clinical trial was initiated for patients with relapsed myeloma with administration of oral lenalidomide on days 1 to 21 and CCI-779 intravenously once per week during a 28-day cycle. Pharmacokinetic data for both agents were obtained, and in vitro transport and uptake studies were conducted to evaluate potential drug-drug interactions.

Results: Twenty-one patients were treated with 15 to 25 mg lenalidomide and 15 to 20 mg CCI-779. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 25 mg lenalidomide with 15 mg CCI-779. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated increased doses of CCI-779 resulted in statistically significant changes in clearance, maximum concentrations, and areas under the concentration-time curves, with constant doses of lenalidomide. Similar and significant changes for CCI-779 pharmacokinetics were also observed with increased lenalidomide doses. Detailed mechanistic interrogation of this pharmacokinetic interaction demonstrated that lenalidomide was an ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein [P-gp]) substrate.

Conclusion: The MTD of this combination regimen was 25 mg lenalidomide with 15 mg CCI-779, with toxicities of fatigue, neutropenia, and electrolyte wasting. Pharmacokinetic and clinical interactions between lenalidomide and CCI-779 seemed to occur, with in vitro data indicating lenalidomide was an ABCB1 (P-gp) substrate.

Here, we report the long-term outcomes.

Methods: Patients with HER2-positive tumors (n = 615) received neoadjuvant treatment with epirubicin (E) plus cyclophosphamide (C), followed by docetaxel (T) in combination with either lapatinib (L) or trastuzumab (H; ECH-TH arm: n = 307; ECL-TL arm: n = 308). All patients received adjuvant trastuzumab for a total of 12 months and 18 months in the ECH-TH and ECL-TL arms, respectively. Median follow-up was 55 months.

Results: Three-year disease-free survival (DFS), distant DFS (DDFS), and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different between the two treatment arms. Long-term outcomes correlated with pCR (DFS: hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; P = .042; DDFS: HR, 0.55; P = .021; and OS: HR, 0.31; P = .004). A benefit only for OS was observed in patients who were treated with trastuzumab and achieved pCR versus no pCR (HR, 0.15; P = .010), whereas no difference was found in patients with pCR versus without pCR in the lapatinib arm. DFS and DDFS remained unchanged in both treatment arms according to hormone receptor status, whereas OS was significantly better in hormone receptorâ€“positive patients who were treated with neoadjuvant lapatinib (HR, 0.32; P = .019), followed by adjuvant trastuzumab. No difference was observed in hormone receptorâ€“negative patients; however, the small number of events limits this interpretation. Within the hormone receptorâ€“negative cohort, pCR was significantly associated with DFS, DDFS, and OS (P = .002, .005, and .002, respectively).

Conclusion: pCR correlated with long-term outcome. In patients with hormone receptorâ€“positive tumors, prolonged anti-HER2 treatmentâ€”neoadjuvant lapatinib for 6 months, followed by adjuvant trastuzumab for 12 monthsâ€”significantly improved survival compared with anti-HER2 treatment with trastuzumab alone.",5/1/2018,"[{'Author': 'Michael Untch', 'Disclosures': ['No relationship to disclose']}, {'Author': 'Gunter von Minckwitz', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Pfizer (Inst), GlaxoSmithKline (Inst), Sanofi (Inst), Amgen (Inst), Roche (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Celgene (Inst), Teva Pharmaceuticals (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Myriad Genetics (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Bernd Gerber', 'Disclosures': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: AstraZeneca, Roche']}, {'Author': 'Christian Schem', 'Disclosures': ['No relationship to disclose']}, {'Author': 'Mahdi Rezai', 'Disclosures': ['No relationship to disclose']}, {'Author': 'Peter A.

Phase I Trial of a Personalized Peptide Vaccine for Patients Positive for Human Leukocyte Antigenâ€“A24 With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma Multiforme,Mizuhiko Terasaki; Soichiro Shibui; Yoshitaka Narita; Takamitsu Fujimaki; Tomokazu Aoki; Koji Kajiwara; Yutaka Sawamura; Kaoru Kurisu; Toshihiro Mineta; Akira Yamada; Kyogo Itoh,"Purpose: Personalized selection of suitable peptides for patients could offer a novel approach to developing cancer vaccines that boost anticancer immunity. We present the results of a phase I trial of 14 kinds of vaccine candidates (ITK-1) in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

Patients and Methods: From January 2006 to January 2008, 12 patients from eight Japanese hospitals who were positive for human leukocyte antigenâ€“A24, including 10 patients refractory to temozolomide (TMZ), were enrolled. The dose escalation trial included three dose groups (1, 3, and 5 mg) to determine the safety and tolerability of ITK-1 peptides. Immunologic response was monitored by measuring levels of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursors and peptide-specific immunoglobulin G. In another ITK-1 phase I trial for advanced prostate cancer, the vaccination schedule was skipped or discontinued in all three patients receiving the highest dose (5 mg/peptide) because of injection site reactions. This trial was therefore ended without enrollment for the highest dose, and data were analyzed by intention to treat.

Methods: TRIPLETE was a prospective, open-label, phase III trial in which previously untreated patients with unresectable RAS and BRAF wt mCRC were randomly assigned 1:1 to modified FOLFOX/panitumumab (control group) or mFOLFOXIRI/panitumumab (experimental group) up to 12 cycles, followed by fluorouracil/-leucovorin/panitumumab until disease progression. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1. Hypothesizing an ORR of 60% in the control group, 432 cases provided 90% power to a two-sided chi-square test for heterogeneity with a two-sided alpha error of .05 to detect â‰¥ 15% differences between arms (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03231722).

Results: From September 2017 to September 2021, 435 patients were enrolled (control group/experimental group: 217/218) in 57 Italian sites. One hundred sixty (73%) patients treated with mFOLFOXIRI plus panitumumab and 165 (76%) patients treated with modified FOLFOX plus panitumumab achieved RECIST response (odds ratio 0.87, 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.34, P = .526). No differences in early tumor shrinkage rate (57%/58%, P = .878) and deepness of response (median: 48%/47%, P = .845) were reported, nor in R0 resection rate (25%/29%, P = .317). No significant difference between arms was reported in terms of progression-free survival (median progression-free survival: 12.7 in the experimental group v 12.3 months in the control group, hazard ratio: 0.88, 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.11, P = .277).

Patients and Methods: Overall, 269 patients were randomly assigned to receive bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 intravenous bolus) or no bortezomib for 1 year, in combination with thalidomide (200 mg per day orally) and dexamethasone (40 mg orally once a day on 4 days once every 3 weeks). Bortezomib was administered on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 with a 10-day rest period (day 12 to day 21) for eight cycles (6 months), and then on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 with a 20-day rest period (day 23 to day 42) for four cycles (6 months).

Results: Median time to progression (primary end point) was significantly longer with VTD than TD (19.5 v 13.8 months; hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.80; P = .001), the complete response plus near-complete response rate was higher (45% v 21%; P = .001), and the median duration of response was longer (17.9 v 13.4 months; P = .04). The 24-month survival rate was in favor of VTD (71% v 65%; P = .093).

Time Interval to Biochemical Failure as a Surrogate End Point in Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: Analysis of Randomized Trial NRG/RTOG 9202,James J.  Dignam; Daniel A.

Sandler,"Background: In prostate cancer, end points that reliably portend prognosis and treatment benefit (surrogate end points) can accelerate therapy development. Although surrogate end point candidates have been evaluated in the context of radiotherapy and short-term androgen deprivation (AD), potential surrogates under long-term (24 month) AD, a proven therapy in high-risk localized disease, have not been investigated.

Materials and Methods: In the NRG/RTOG 9202 randomized trial (N = 1,520) of short-term AD (4 months) versus long-term AD (LTAD; 28 months), the time interval free of biochemical failure (IBF) was evaluated in relation to clinical end points of prostate cancerâ€“specific survival (PCSS) and overall survival (OS). Survival modeling and landmark analysis methods were applied to evaluate LTAD benefit on IBF and clinical end points, association between IBF and clinical end points, and the mediating effect of IBF on LTAD clinical end point benefits.

Results: LTAD was superior to short-term AD for both biochemical failure (BF) and the clinical end points. Men remaining free of BF for 3 years had relative risk reductions of 39% for OS and 73% for PCSS. Accounting for 3-year IBF status reduced the LTAD OS benefit from 12% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.98) to 6% (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.07). For PCSS, the LTAD benefit was reduced from 30% (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.82) to 6% (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.22). Among men with BF, by 3 years, 50% of subsequent deaths were attributed to prostate cancer, compared with 19% among men free of BF through 3 years.

Conclusion: The IBF satisfied surrogacy criteria and identified the benefit of LTAD on disease-specific survival and OS. The IBF may serve as a valid end point in clinical trials and may also aid in risk monitoring after initial treatment.",1/20/2019,"[{'Author': 'James J.

A Multicenter Phase II Trial of Ruxolitinib for Treatment of Corticosteroid Refractory Sclerotic Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease,Vijaya Raj  Bhatt; Valerie K.  Shostrom; Hannah K.  Choe; Betty K.  Hamilton; Krishna  Gundabolu; Lori J.  Maness; Virender  Kumar; Ram I.  Mahato; Lynette M.  Smith; Taiga  Nishihori; Stephanie J.  Lee,"Purpose: Sclerotic chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) represents a highly morbid and refractory form of cGVHD, and novel therapies for sclerotic cGVHD are critically needed. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients with corticosteroid refractory sclerotic cGVHD.

Patients and Methods: In a single-arm multicenter phase II trial (N = 47), adults with sclerotic cGVHD refractory to corticosteroids and â‰¥one additional line of systemic therapy for cGVHD received ruxolitinib for â‰¥six months (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03616184). The primary end point was complete or partial response (PR) in skin and/or joint defined according to the 2014 National Institute of Health cGVHD Consensus Criteria.

Results: Following the use of ruxolitinib for a median of 11 months, PR in skin and/or joints was noted in 49% (95% CI, 34 to 64) at 6 months, with 45% having joint and fascia response and 19% having skin response. The duration of skin/joint response was 77% (95% CI, 48 to 91) at 12 months. Overall cGVHD PR was noted in 47% (95% CI, 32 to 61). Improvement in Lee Symptom Scale summary and skin subscale scores was noted in 38% of patients. With a cumulative incidence of treatment failure of 20.8% (95% CI, 10.0 to 34.1), nonrelapse mortality (NRM) of 2.2% (95% CI, 0.17 to 10.3), and no recurrent malignancy, failure-free survival (FFS) was 77.1% (95% CI, 61.3 to 87.0) at 12 months. Ruxolitinib was overall well tolerated with no new safety signals.

Conclusion: The use of ruxolitinib was associated with relatively high rates of skin/joint responses and overall cGVHD responses, improvement in patient-reported outcomes, low NRM, and high FFS in patients with refractory sclerotic cGVHD.

Bernhardt; Stephanie A.  Terezakis; Lia  Gore; James A.  Whitlock; Stephen P.  Hunger; Mignon L.  Loh,"Purpose: Blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager immunotherapy, is efficacious in relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL (B-ALL) and has a favorable toxicity profile. One aim of the Children's Oncology Group AALL1331 study was to compare survival of patients with low-risk (LR) first relapse of B-ALL treated with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus blinatumomab.

Patients and Methods: After block 1 reinduction, patients age 1-30 years with LR first relapse of B-ALL were randomly assigned to block 2/block 3/two continuation chemotherapy cycles/maintenance (arm C) or block 2/two cycles of continuation chemotherapy intercalated with three blinatumomab blocks/maintenance (arm D). Patients with CNS leukemia received 18 Gy cranial radiation during maintenance and intensified intrathecal chemotherapy. The primary and secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

Results: The 4-year DFS/OS for the 255 LR patients accrued between December 2014 and September 2019 were 61.2% Â± 5.0%/90.4% Â± 3.0% for blinatumomab versus 49.5% Â± 5.2%/79.6% Â± 4.3% for chemotherapy (P = .089/P = .11). For bone marrow (BM) Â± extramedullary (EM) (BM Â± EM; n = 174) relapses, 4-year DFS/OS were 72.7% Â± 5.8%/97.1% Â± 2.1% for blinatumomab versus 53.7% Â± 6.7%/84.8% Â± 4.8% for chemotherapy (P = .015/P = .020). For isolated EM (IEM; n = 81) relapses, 4-year DFS/OS were 36.6% Â± 8.2%/76.5% Â± 7.5% for blinatumomab versus 38.8% Â± 8.0%/68.8% Â± 8.6% for chemotherapy (P = .62/P = .53). Blinatumomab was well tolerated and patients had low adverse event rates.

Conclusion: For children, adolescents, and young adults with B-ALL in LR first relapse, there was no statistically significant difference in DFS or OS between the blinatumomab and standard chemotherapy arms overall. However, blinatumomab significantly improved DFS and OS for the two thirds of patients with BM Â± EM relapse, establishing a new standard of care for this population. By contrast, similar outcomes and poor DFS for both arms were observed in the one third of patients with IEM; new treatment approaches are needed for these patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02101853).",9/1/2023,"[{'Author': 'Patrick A.

FOLFOXIRI Plus Cetuximab or Bevacizumab as First-Line Treatment of BRAFV600E-Mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: The Randomized Phase II FIRE-4.5 (AIO KRK0116) Study,Sebastian  Stintzing; Kathrin  Heinrich; David  Tougeron; Dominik Paul  Modest; Ingo  Schwaner; Jan  Eucker; Rudolf  Pihusch; Martina  Stauch; Florian  Kaiser; Christoph  Kahl; Meinolf  Karthaus; Christian  MÃ¼ller; Christof  Burkart; Anke  Reinacher-Schick; Stefan  Kasper-Virchow; Ludwig  Fischer von Weikersthal; Beate  Krammer-Steiner; Gerald Wolfgang  Prager; Julien  Taieb; Volker  Heinemann,"Purpose: BRAFV600E mutation is associated with a poor outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This clinical trial investigated the efficacy of triplet chemotherapy (fluorouracil, folinic acid, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) combined with either cetuximab or bevacizumab in patients with previously untreated BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC.

Patients and Methods: In this controlled, randomized, open-label phase II trial, 109 patients were randomly assigned, 107 of whom were included into the full analysis set (FAS). Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab in the experimental arm (n = 72) or FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab in the control arm (n = 35). The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1., evaluated in patients treated according to protocol (ATP population). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and feasibility were analyzed as secondary end points.

Results: Eighteen patients discontinued study treatment before the first tumor assessment, thus resulting in the ATP population of 89 patients. In these patients, ORR was 51% (30/59) in the cetuximab-based experimental arm and 67% (20/30) in the bevacizumab-based control arm (odds ratio, 1.93; 80% CI, 1.06 to 3.52; P = .92 [one-sided]). In the full analysis set, median PFS was significantly inferior in the experimental arm (6.7 months v 10.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.89; P = .006). Median OS analyzed at an event rate of 64.5% showed a trend toward shorter survival in cetuximab-treated patients (12.9 months v 17.1 months; HR, 1.4; P = .20).

Conclusion: To our knowledge, FIRE-4.5 is the first prospective and randomized study investigating first-line treatment of BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC. FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab does not induce a higher ORR when compared with FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab in first-line treatment of BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC. Bevacizumab-based chemotherapy remains the preferable first-line treatment of patients with BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC.",9/1/2023,"[{'Author': 'Sebastian Stintzing', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Merck KGaA,

Siegel; Chunyi  Hao,"Purpose: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patients from Asia with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Methods: In a double-blind, phase III trial, 453 patients with advanced HCC and progression during or after treatment with or intolerance to sorafenib or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) or placebo once every 3 weeks for â‰¤ 35 cycles plus best supportive care. The primary end point was overall survival (one-sided significance threshold, P = .0193 [final analysis]). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR; one-sided significance threshold, P = .0134 and .0091, respectively [second interim analysis]; RECIST version 1.1, by blinded independent central review).

Results: Median overall survival was longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group (14.6 v 13.0 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.99; P = .0180). Median PFS was also longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group (2.6 v 2.3 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.92; P = .0032). ORR was greater in the pembrolizumab group (12.7% [95% CI, 9.1 to 17.0]) than in the placebo group (1.3% [95% CI, 0.2 to 4.6]; P < .0001). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 66.9% of patients (grade 3, 12.0%; grade 4, 1.3%; grade 5, 1.0%) in the pembrolizumab group and 49.7% of patients (grade 3, 5.9%; grade 4, 0%; grade 5, 0%) in the placebo group.

Conclusion: In patients from Asia with previously treated advanced HCC, pembrolizumab significantly prolonged overall survival and PFS, and ORR was greater versus placebo.",3/1/2023,"[{'Author': 'Zhenggang Ren', 'Disclosures': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Roche, Merck Sharp & Dohme']}, {'Author': 'Gwo Fuang Ho', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria: Merck, Novartis, Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZeneca', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Roche/Genentech', 'Research Funding: Merck Sharp & Dohme (Inst), Samsung Bioepis (Inst), Tessa Therapeutics (Inst), AB Science (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Lilly (Inst), Regeneron (Inst), Kura Oncology (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Arcus Ventures (Inst), Astellas Pharma (Inst), Roche (Inst)']}, {'Author': 'Jianfeng Li', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: MSD, China']}, {'Author': 'Wenyan Zhong', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: MSD, China']}, {'Author': 'Yu Zhou', 'Disclosures': ['Employment: MSD, China']}, {'Author': 'Abby B.

Grever; Guido Marcucci, and; John C. Byrd","Purpose: Lenalidomide is effective in myeloma and low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with deletion 5q. We report results of a phase I dose-escalation trial of lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory acute leukemia.

Patients and Methods: Thirty-one adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and four adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were enrolled. Lenalidomide was given orally at escalating doses of 25 to 75 mg daily on days 1 through 21 of 28-day cycles to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), as well as to provide pharmacokinetic and preliminary efficacy data.

Results: Patients had a median age of 63 years (range, 22 to 79 years) and a median of two prior therapies (range, one to four therapies). The DLT was fatigue; 50 mg/d was the MTD. Infectious complications were frequent. Plasma lenalidomide concentration increased proportionally with dose. In AML, five (16%) of 31 patients achieved complete remission (CR); three of three patients with cytogenetic abnormalities achieved cytogenetic CR (none with deletion 5q). Response duration ranged from 5.6 to 14 months. All responses occurred in AML with low presenting WBC count. No patient with ALL responded. Two of four patients who received lenalidomide as initial therapy for AML relapse after allogeneic transplantation achieved durable CR after development of cutaneous graft-versus-host disease, without donor leukocyte infusion.

Conclusion: Lenalidomide was safely escalated to 50 mg daily for 21 days, every 4 weeks, and was active with relatively low toxicity in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Remissions achieved after transplantation suggest a possible immunomodulatory effect of lenalidomide, and results provide enthusiasm for further studies in AML, either alone or in combination with conventional agents or other immunotherapies.",11/20/2010,"[{'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Stock Ownership:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Honoraria:']}, {'Author': 'William Blum', 'Disclosures': ['Research Funding: Celgene']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Expert Testimony:']}, {'Author': 'None', 'Disclosures': ['Other Remuneration:']}]",lenalidomide,Celgene,1,1,

Berdel,"Purpose: The prognosis of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still dismal even with intensive chemotherapy. In this trial, we compared the antileukemic activity of standard induction and consolidation therapy with or without the addition of the kinase inhibitor sorafenib in elderly patients with AML.

Patients and Methods: All patients received standard cytarabine and daunorubicin induction (7+3 regimen) and up to two cycles of intermediate-dose cytarabine consolidation. Two hundred one patients were equally randomly assigned to receive either sorafenib or placebo between the chemotherapy cycles and subsequently for up to 1 year after the beginning of therapy. The primary objective was to test for an improvement in event-free survival (EFS). Overall survival (OS), complete remission (CR) rate, tolerability, and several predefined subgroup analyses were among the secondary objectives.

Results: Age, sex, CR and early death (ED) probability, and prognostic factors were balanced between both study arms. Treatment in the sorafenib arm did not result in significant improvement in EFS or OS. This was also true for subgroup analyses, including the subgroup positive for FLT3 internal tandem duplications. Results of induction therapy were worse in the sorafenib arm, with higher treatment-related mortality and lower CR rates. More adverse effects occurred during induction therapy in the sorafenib arm, and patients in this arm received less consolidation chemotherapy as a result of higher induction toxicity.

Conclusion: In conclusion, combination of standard induction and consolidation therapy with sorafenib in the schedule investigated in our trial is not beneficial for elderly patients with AML.",9/1/2013,"[{'Author': 'Christian Thiede', 'Disclosures': ['Employment or Leadership: AgenDix GmbH (U)']}, {'Author': 'Hubert Serve', 'Disclosures': ['Consultant or Advisory Role: Sorafenib (U)']}, {'Author': 'Wolfgang E.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.

ARST1321 was a phase II study designed to compare the near complete pathologic response rate after preoperative chemoradiation with/without pazopanib in children and adults with intermediate-/high-risk chemotherapy-sensitive body wall/extremity non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcoma (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02180867). Enrollment was stopped early following a predetermined interim analysis that found the rate of near complete pathologic response to be significantly greater with the addition of pazopanib. As a planned secondary aim of the study, the outcome data for this cohort were analyzed. Eight-five eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive (regimen A) or not receive (regimen B) pazopanib in combination with ifosfamide and doxorubicin + preoperative radiotherapy followed by primary resection at week 13 and then further chemotherapy at week 25. As of December 31, 2021, at a median survivor follow-up of 3.3 years (range, 0.1-5.8 years), the 3-year event-free survival for all patients in the intent-to-treat analysis was 52.5% (95% CI, 34.8 to 70.2) for regimen A and 50.6% (95% CI, 32 to 69.2) for regimen B (P = .8677, log-rank test); the 3-year overall survival was 75.7% (95% CI, 59.7 to 91.7) for regimen A and 65.4% (95% CI, 48.1 to 82.7) for regimen B (P = .1919, log-rank test).

The Intergroupe Francophone du MyÃ©lome (IFM) decided to evaluate RVD induction and consolidation therapies in a sequential intensive strategy for previously untreated transplantation-eligible patients with MM.

Patients and Methods: In this phase II study, 31 symptomatic patients age < 65 years were enrolled to receive three RVD induction cycles followed by cyclophosphamide harvest and transplantation. Patients subsequently received two RVD consolidation cycles and 1-year lenalidomide maintenance.

Results: Very good partial response rate or better at the completion of induction, transplantation, and consolidation therapy was 58%, 70%, and 87%, respectively. Maintenance upgraded responses in 27% of patients. Overall, 58% of patients achieved complete response, and 68% were minimal residual disease (MRD) negative by flow cytometry. The most common toxicities with RVD were neurologic and hematologic, including grade 1 to 2 sensory neuropathy (55%), grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (35%), and thrombocytopenia (13%). Two basal cell carcinomas in the same patient and one case of breast cancer were observed. There was no treatment-related mortality. With a median follow-up of 39 months, estimated 3-year progression-free and overall survival were 77% and 100%, respectively. None of the patients who achieved MRD negativity relapsed.

Conclusion: The transplantation program with RVD induction and consolidation followed by lenalidomide maintenance produced high-quality responses and showed favorable tolerability in patients with newly diagnosed MM. Overall, 68% of patients achieved MRD negativity; none of these patients relapsed.
