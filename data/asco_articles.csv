This study evaluated the automated heart-health assessment (AH-HA) clinical decision support tool to promote provider-patient CV health (CVH) discussions in outpatient oncology.

Methods: The AH-HA trial (WF-1804CD), coordinated by the Wake Forest National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program Research Base, randomized practices to the AH-HA tool or usual care (UC) and enrolled survivors receiving routine care ≥6 months after curative cancer treatment. The tool displayed American Heart Association Life's Simple 7 CVH factors (BMI, physical activity, diet, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose), populated from the electronic health record (EHR), alongside cancer treatments received with cardiotoxic potential. The primary end point was survivor-reported discussion of nonideal or missing CVH factors. A mixed-effects logistic regression model assessed the effect of AH-HA on CVH discussions, adjusting for practice.

Results: Five UC and four AH-HA practices enrolled 645 survivors (82% breast, 8% endometrial, 5% colorectal, and 5% lymphoma, prostate, or multiple types) from October 1, 2020, to February 28, 2023. Most survivors were female (96%; 84% White/non-Hispanic, 8% Black; 3% Hispanic). Nearly all survivors (98%) in AH-HA practices reported a discussion for ≥1 nonideal or missing CVH factor compared with 55% in UC (P < .001). The average number of survivor-reported factors discussed was higher in AH-HA compared with UC (mean, 4.06 v 1.27; P < .001), as were EHR-documented discussions (3.83 v 0.77; P = .03). Survivors in AH-HA practices were also significantly more likely to report a recommendation to see a primary care provider (39%) compared with UC practices (25%, P = .02). Reported recommendations to see a cardiologist were low (approximately 6%) and did not differ between groups.

Conclusion: The AH-HA tool was effective at promoting CVH discussions during routine follow-up care for survivors and recommendations to consult primary care.",1/1/2025,JCO.24.00342,"{'Emily V.

Patients and Methods: EWALL-INO is an open-label prospective multicenter phase II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03249870). Patients age 55 years and older with newly diagnosed CD22+ Philadelphia chromosome–negative (Ph–) B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL were eligible. After a prephase, a first induction consisting of vincristine, dexamethasone, and three injections of InO (0.8 mg/m2 day 1, 0.5 mg/m2 day 8/day 15) was followed by a second induction combining cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, and two injections of InO (0.5 mg/m2 day 1/day 8). Responders received up to six cycles of chemotherapy consolidation and 18-month chemotherapy maintenance. Allotransplant was allowed after three consolidations. The primary end point was 1-year overall survival (OS).

Results: Between December 2017 and March 2022, 131 patients (median age 68 years) were included. Three patients died during induction 1 (n = 130), two from multiple organ failure and one from hemorrhage, and none during induction 2 (n = 120). After induction 2, 90% of the patients achieved complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) and 80% had measurable residual disease (MRD2) <10−4. Among responders (n = 119), 47 relapsed and 14 died in CR/CRp. One-year OS, relapse-free survival (RFS), and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rates were 73.2%, 66%, and 25%, respectively. High-risk cytogenetics and lower CD22 expression (<70%) were associated with worse OS, while both high-risk cytogenetics and MRD2 ≥10−4 were associated with lower RFS and higher CIR. The 10 allotransplanted patients had very favorable outcomes (90% 2-year OS/RFS and no relapse). Only one nonfatal sinusoidal obstructive syndrome was documented during the study.

NRG-RTOG1106/ECOG-ACRIN6697 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01507428), a randomized phase II trial, studied whether midtreatment 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) can guide individualized/adaptive dose-intensified radiotherapy (RT) to improve and predict outcomes in patients with this disease.

Materials and Methods: Patients fit for concurrent chemoradiation were randomly assigned (1:2) to standard (60 Gy/30 fractions) or FDG-PET–guided adaptive treatment, stratified by substage, primary tumor size, and histology. All patients had midtreatment FDG-PET/CT; adaptive arm patients had an individualized, intensified boost RT dose to residual metabolically active areas. The primary therapeutic end point was 2-year centrally reviewed freedom from local-regional progression (FFLP), defined as no progression in or near the planning target volume and/or regional nodes. FFLP was analyzed on a modified intent-to-treat population at a one-sided Z-test significance level of 0.15. The primary imaging end point was centrally reviewed change in SUVpeak from baseline to midtreatment; its association with FFLP was assessed using the two-sided Wald test on the basis of Cox regression.

Results: Of 138 patients enrolled, 127 were eligible. Adaptive-arm patients received a mean 71 Gy in 30 fractions, with mean lung dose 17.9 Gy. There was no significant difference in centrally reviewed 2-year FFLP (59.5% and 54.6% in standard and adaptive arms; P = .66). There were no significant differences in protocol-specified grade 3 toxicities, survival, or progression-free survival (P > .4). Median SUVpeak and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) in the adaptive arm decreased 49% and 54%, from pre-RT to mid-RT PET. However, ΔSUVpeak and ΔMTV were not associated with FFLP (hazard ratios, 0.997; P = .395 and .461).

Conclusion: Midtreatment PET-adapted RT dose escalation as given in this study was safe and feasible but did not improve efficacy outcomes.",11/20/2024,JCO.24.00022,"{'Feng-Ming (Spring) Kong': ['Leadership: Global Collaborative Oncology Group', 'Honoraria: Varian Medical Systems', ""Speakers' Bureau: Varian Medical Systems, Roche, AstraZeneca, Merck"", 'Research Funding: Varian Medical Systems', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Varian Medical Systems'], 'Chen Hu': ['This author is a member of the Journal of Clinical Oncology Editorial Board.

Patients AND Methods: NRG-GY005 is an open-label, four-arm, phase II/III superiority trial enrolling patients with high-grade serous/endometrioid PROC and one to three previous therapies. Key exclusion criteria included previous receipt of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor or receipt of antiangiogenic therapy in the recurrent setting. Treatment arms (SOC [once weekly paclitaxel, topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin], cediranib, olaparib, or cediranib/olaparib) were equally randomized. A preplanned interim futility analysis on the basis of progression-free survival (PFS) selected treatment arms to advance to phase III. PFS and overall survival (OS) were phase III coprimary end points, with hierarchical testing of PFS followed by OS to preserve type 1 error control, designed to have 90% power for a 0.625 PFS hazard ratio (HR). OS was tested after PFS in the multiple hierarchical testing procedure. Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR) and patient-reported outcomes.

Results: Five hundred sixty-two eligible patients were enrolled for phase II/III. Three arms met PFS criteria to carry forward to phase III (SOC, cediranib/olaparib, and cediranib). Median PFS was 3.4, 5.2, and 4 months with SOC, cediranib/olaparib, and cediranib, respectively, with a median follow-up duration of 42.2 months. PFS HR estimates for cediranib/olaparib and cediranib (v SOC) were 0.796 (98.3% CI, 0.597 to 1.060) and 0.972 (98.3% CI, 0.726 to 1.300), respectively. Median OS was 13.6, 12.8, and 10.5 months, and of 443 patients with measurable disease, ORR was 8.6%, 24.7%, and 13.1% for SOC, cediranib/olaparib, and cediranib, respectively. No new safety signals were identified. In patients receiving cediranib/olaparib, no statistically significant difference was observed on the NFOSI-DRS-P subscale compared with SOC (98.3% CI, –1.3 to 1.5, P = .8725).

Conclusion: The cediranib-containing arms demonstrated clinical activity on the basis of PFS but were not superior compared with SOC.",12/20/2024,JCO.24.00683,{}

It is critical to evaluate whether NPC screening can reduce NPC-specific mortality in the population.

Methods: Sixteen towns in Sihui and Zhongshan cities, China, were selected; eight were randomly allocated to the screening group and eight to the control group. Residents age 30-69 years with no history of NPC were included from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2015. Residents in the screening towns were invited to undergo serum Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen/nuclear antigen 1-immunoglobulin A antibody tests; others received no intervention. The population was followed until December 31, 2019. Nonparametric tests and Poisson regression models were used to estimate the screening effect on NPC mortality, accounting for the cluster-randomized design. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT00941538).

Results: A total of 174,943 residents in the screening group and 186,263 residents in the control group were included. NPC incidence and overall mortality were similar between the two groups. A total of 52,498 (30.0% of 174,943) residents participated in the serum EBV antibody test. The overall compliance rate for endoscopic examination and/or biopsies among baseline and ever-classified high-risk participants was 65.9% (1,110 of 1,685) and 67.6% (1,703 of 2,518), respectively. A significant 30% reduction in NPC mortality was observed in the screening group compared with the control group (standardized NPC-specific mortality rate of 8.2 NPC deaths per 1,000 person-years versus 12.5; adjusted rate ratio [RR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.49 to 0.997]; P = .048). This benefit was most evident among individuals age 50 years and older (RR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.37 to 0.85]; P = .007) compared with those younger than 50 years (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.64 to 1.46]; P = .856).

Materials and Methods: A phase I/IIb trial of pembrolizumab with RT was conducted in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HR+/HER2–) breast cancer. All received pembrolizumab followed by a second cycle + RT (anti-PD1/RT) of 24 Gy/three daily fractions delivered to the breast tumor and then neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Blood and tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline, after anti-PD1, and after anti–PD-RT. Coprimary end points were safety and change in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Secondary end points were pathologic complete response (pCR), residual cancer burden (RCB) rates, and event-free survival (EFS).

Results: Sixty-six patients with stage I-III breast cancer (54 TNBC, 12 HR+/HER2–) were enrolled. The median follow-up was 32 months. Safety end point was met. Incidence of grade ≥3 toxicities was 41%. The pCR rate was 59.2%, 33.3%, and 54.5% for the TNBC, HR+/HER2–, and entire cohort, respectively. A total of 77.8% of TNBC and 41.6% of HR+/HER2– had a near pCR (RCB 0-1). The 3-year EFS was 80%. In the entire cohort, PD-L1 expression increased after anti-PD1 (median Combined Positive Score [CPS], 7.49-23.20; 95% CI, –41.88 to –6.30; P = .044) and anti-PD1/RT (median CPS, 7.49-23.41; 95% CI, –41.88 to –6.30; P = .009), compared with baseline. In TNBC, adding RT to anti-PD1 significantly decreased TILs (28.9%-17.1%; 95% CI, 2.46 to 21.09; P = .014). Baseline TILs correlated with PD-L1 expression and TNF-a.

Conclusion: Preoperative RT with pembrolizumab is safe and results in high pCR rates and 3-year EFS, despite the lack of pembrolizumab during NAC. PD-L1 and TILs may be predictive biomarkers for preoperative anti-PD1/RT response. Reduction in TILs after adding RT to anti-PD1 highlights the importance of treatment sequencing.",12/20/2024,JCO.24.00003,"{'Alice Y.

Methods: The multicenter placebo-controlled double-blind randomized phase III ENGOT-OV41/GEICO 69-O/ANITA trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03598270) enrolled patients with measurable high-grade serous, endometrioid, or undifferentiated recurrent ovarian cancer who had received one or two previous CT lines (most recent including platinum) and had a treatment-free interval since last platinum (TFIp) of >6 months. Patients were stratified by investigator-selected carboplatin doublet, TFIp, BRCA status, and PD-L1 status in de novo biopsy and randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either atezolizumab or placebo throughout standard therapy comprising six cycles of a carboplatin doublet followed (in patients with response/stable disease) by maintenance niraparib until progression. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1.

Results: Between November 2018 and January 2022, 417 patients were randomly assigned (15% BRCA-mutated, 36% PD-L1–positive, 66% TFIp >12 months, 11% previous poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase inhibitor after frontline CT, and 53% previous bevacizumab). Median follow-up was 28.6 months (95% CI, 26.6 to 30.5 months). Atezolizumab did not significantly improve PFS (hazard ratio, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.71 to 1.10]; P = .28). Median PFS was 11.2 months (95% CI, 10.1 to 12.1 months) with atezolizumab versus 10.1 months (95% CI, 9.2 to 11.2 months) with standard therapy. Subgroup analyses generally showed consistent results, including analyses by PD-L1 status. The objective response rate (ORR) was 45% (95% CI, 39 to 52) with atezolizumab and 43% (95% CI, 36 to 49) with standard therapy. The safety profile was as expected from previous experience of these drugs.

Conclusion: Combining atezolizumab with CT and maintenance niraparib for late-relapsing recurrent ovarian cancer did not significantly improve PFS or the ORR.",12/20/2024,JCO.24.00668,"{'Antonio

Patients and Methods: Patients age 18-65 years with newly diagnosed AML were randomly assigned to 60 versus 90 mg/m2 daunorubicin once daily plus cytarabine. Patients with marrow blasts below 5% on day 15 after first induction were randomly assigned to receive a second induction cycle or no second induction cycle.

Results: Eight hundred and sixty-four patients with a median age of 52 years were randomly assigned. After a preplanned interim analysis showing no significant difference in response between 60 and 90 mg/m2, all consecutive patients received 60 mg/m2 daunorubicin once daily. The proportion of good early responders was 44% versus 48% (P = .983) with a composite complete remission (CRc) rate of 90% versus 89% after induction (P = .691); the 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) after 60 versus 90 mg/m2 once daily was 54% versus 50% (P = .561), and the 3-year overall survival (OS) was 65% versus 58% (P = .242). Among 389 good responders, CRc rates at the end of induction were 87% after single induction and 85% after double induction. The 3-year RFS was 51% versus 60% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.3; P = .091), and the 3-year OS was 76% versus 75% after single versus double induction (HR, 1.0; P = .937).

Conclusion: The use of 90 mg/m2 daunorubicin once daily in the context of classical 7 + 3 induction does not significantly improve early response and does not lead to higher remission rates or longer survival than 60 mg/m2 once daily. In patients with a good early response after first induction, a second induction has only a limited impact on RFS and does not result in an OS benefit.",1/1/2025,JCO.24.00235,"{'Christoph Röllig': ['This author is a member of the Journal of Clinical Oncology Editorial Board.

We assessed the effect of a psychological intervention (NeuroCARE) on anxiety symptoms among PMBT caregivers.

Methods: We conducted a randomized trial of NeuroCARE versus usual care in PMBT caregivers with elevated anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score ≥5) within 6 months of the patient's diagnosis. NeuroCARE was developed for PMBT caregivers and consists of six telehealth sessions with a behavioral health specialist. Participants completed surveys at baseline, 11-week (postintervention), and 16-week (1-month postintervention) time points. The primary outcome was 11-week anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]-Anxiety Subscale). We also measured depression symptoms (HADS-Depression Subscale), quality of life (QOL; Caregiver QOL survey), caregiver burden (Caregiver Reaction Assessment), self-efficacy (Lewis Cancer Self-Efficacy Scale), coping (Measure of Current Status), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5). We conducted analysis of covariance and linear mixed-effects regression analyses to examine intervention effects on study outcomes.

Results: We enrolled 120 caregivers (60/group) between October 2019 and June 2022; 105 were evaluable for the primary outcome. At 11 weeks, NeuroCARE participants reported significantly lower anxiety symptoms than usual care participants (M, 8.87 v 10.69; P = .008). NeuroCARE caregivers also reported significantly lower depression symptoms (M, 6.08 v 7.77; P = .004), and better self-efficacy (M, 128.81 v 111.17; P < .001) and coping (M, 32.25 v 25.65; P < .001) at 11 weeks. Study groups did not differ significantly in 11-week QOL, caregiver burden, or PTSD symptoms. In longitudinal analyses, intervention effects on depression symptoms, self-efficacy, and coping were sustained.

Conclusion: A novel, population-specific psychological intervention led to improved anxiety and depression symptoms, self-efficacy, and coping among PMBT caregivers.",12/20/2024,JCO.24.00065,"{'Deborah A.

Darolutamide in Combination With Androgen-Deprivation Therapy in Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer From the Phase III ARANOTE Trial,Fred  Saad; Egils  Vjaters; Neal  Shore; David  Olmos; Nianzeng  Xing; Andrea Juliana  Pereira de Santana Gomes; Augusto  Cesar de Andrade Mota; Pamela  Salman; Mindaugas  Jievaltas; Albertas  Ulys; Maris  Jakubovskis; Evgeny  Kopyltsov; Weiqing  Han; Liina  Nevalaita; Isabella  Testa; Marie-Aude  Le Berre; Iris  Kuss; Kunhi Parambath  Haresh,Canada; Latvia; SC; Spain; China; Brazil; Brazil; Chile; Lithuania; Lithuania; Latvia; Russian Federation; China; Finland; Italy; France; Germany; India,"Purpose: For patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), delaying progression to castration-resistant disease is important not only for overall survival (OS) but also for patients' quality of life. Darolutamide plus androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with docetaxel improved OS versus ADT and docetaxel in patients with mHSPC. The ARANOTE trial evaluated darolutamide and ADT without chemotherapy in patients with mHSPC.

Methods: In this global phase III trial, patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or placebo, with concomitant ADT. The primary end point was radiological progression-free survival (rPFS).

Results: From March 2021 to August 2022, 669 patients were randomly assigned (darolutamide n = 446; placebo n = 223). At the primary cutoff date (June 7, 2024), darolutamide plus ADT significantly improved rPFS, reducing the risk of radiological progression or death by 46% versus placebo plus ADT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.71]; P < .0001), with consistent benefits across subgroups, including high- and low-volume disease. OS results were suggestive of benefit with darolutamide versus placebo (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.12]), and clinical benefits were seen across all other secondary end points, including delayed time to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.32 to 0.51]) and time to pain progression (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96]). Adverse events were similar in the two groups. Notably, the incidence of fatigue was lower in patients receiving darolutamide (5.6%) versus those receiving placebo (8.1%), and fewer patients receiving darolutamide (6.1%) versus placebo (9.0%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events.

Conclusion: These results confirm the efficacy and tolerability of darolutamide plus ADT in patients with mHSPC, demonstrating clinically and statistically significant improvement in rPFS and a favorable safety profile consistent with prior phase III darolutamide trials.",12/20/2024,JCO-24-01798,"{'Fred Saad': ['Honoraria: Astellas Pharma, Janssen Oncology, Sanofi, Bayer, AstraZeneca, AbbVie, Myovant Sciences, Pfizer, BMS, Novartis, Advanced Accelerator Applications, Merck, Knight Therapeutics, Tolmar', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Astellas Pharma, Janssen Oncology, Sanofi, AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Bayer, Pfizer, Myovant Sciences, AbbVie, Novartis, Advanced Accelerator Applications, Knight Therapeutics, Tolmar', 'Research Funding: Astellas Pharma (Inst), Bayer (Inst), Janssen Oncology (Inst), Sanofi (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Advanced Accelerator Applications (Inst), Merck (Inst)'], 'Egils Vjaters': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen, Bayer, Ipsen'], 'Neal Shore': ['Employment: GenesisCare', 'Leadership: Photocure, Alessa Therapeutics', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Alessa Therapeutics, Photocure', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Bayer, Janssen Scientific Affairs, Dendreon, Tolmar, Ferring, Medivation/Astellas, Amgen, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Astellas Pharma, AbbVie, Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb/Sanofi, Exact Imaging, FerGene, InVitae, MDxHealth, Myriad Genetics, Propella Therapeutics, Genzyme, Sanofi, CG Oncology, Genesis Cancer Care, Urogen pharma, Speciality Networks, PeerView, Clarity Pharmaceuticals, Lantheus Medical Imaging, Lilly, Photocure, Telix Pharmaceuticals, AIkido Pharma, Arquer Diagnostics, Asieris Pharmaceuticals, Minomic, Novartis, PlatformQ Health, Promaxo, Protara Therapeutics, Fize Medical, Accord Research, Antev, Aura Biosciences, Bioprotect, Sumitomo Pharma Oncology', 'Research Funding: AbbVie, Amgen, Astellas Pharma, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer, Boston Scientific, Clovis Oncology, Dendreon, Exact Imaging, Ferring, Foundation Medicine, InVitae, Janssen, MDxHealth, Merck, Myovant Sciences, Myriad Genetics, Nymox, Pfizer, Sanofi, Sesen Bio, Tolmar, CG Oncology, DisperSol, FORMA Therapeutics, Guardant Health, Jiangsu Yahong Meditech, Novartis, Pacific Edge, POINT Biopharma, Propella Therapeutics, SeaGen, MT Group, Theralase, Veru, Zenflow, Advantagene, Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Endocyte, Exelixis, FKD Therapies, Genentech, Istari Oncology, Medivation, OncoCellMDx, ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Palette Life Sciences, Plexxikon, RhoVac, Steba Biotech, Urogen pharma, Urotronic, US Biotest, Vaxiion', 'Expert Testimony: Ferring'], 'David Olmos': ['Honoraria: Janssen, Bayer', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen, AstraZeneca, Bayer, MSD Oncology, Pfizer', 'Research Funding: Pfizer (Inst), Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bayer, Janssen, AstraZeneca Spain'], 'Andrea Juliana P. de Santana Gomes': ['Honoraria: Astellas Pharma, Bayer, Janssen Oncology, AstraZeneca, Adium Pharma', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen Oncology, Bayer', ""Speakers' Bureau: Janssen Oncology, Astellas Pharma, Bayer, AstraZeneca"", 'Research Funding: Janssen Oncology, MSD Oncology, Bayer, Roche, AstraZeneca', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen Oncology'], 'Augusto Cesar de Andrade Mota': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Pfizer, Janssen Oncology, Merck, Bayer', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bayer'], 'Pamela Salman': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche/Genentech, Novartis, Lilly, Merck Serono', ""Speakers' Bureau: Roche/Genentech, Novartis, Lilly""], 'Mindaugas Jievaltas': ['Research Funding: Janssen (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: IPSEN, Janssen, Recordati'], 'Maris Jakubovskis': ['Employment: Riga East University Hospital, JSC Health Center Association', 'Leadership: Ltd Urologs', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Joint stock company “Olainfarm” Registration Nr.LV40003007246'], 'Liina Nevalaita': ['Employment: Orion', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Nevalaita L and Saarma M.

We present a first-in-human phase I clinical trial systemically administered B7-H3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells for young patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

Patients and Methods: Patients were enrolled onto a phase I trial to examine the safety of B7-H3–specific CARs at various dose levels (DLs) using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design.

Results: Sixteen patients (range, 11-24 years; median, 18.5 years) were enrolled, and nine were treated at DL1 (0.5 × 106 CAR T cells/kg; n = 3) or DL2 (1 × 106 CAR T cells/kg; n = 6). There were no first infusion dose-limiting toxicities. Maximum first-infusion circulating CAR T cells detected in the peripheral blood were 4.98 cells/μL (range, 0-4.98 cells/μL) with detection of CAR T cells colocalizing with tumor cells at the site of metastatic disease in one patient. Patients were eligible for subsequent infusions. An objective partial response by PERCIST criteria was observed 28 days after a second CAR T cell infusion in a patient who did not have an objective response after the first infusion. The second infusion demonstrated marked enhancement of CAR T cell expansion to 1,590 cells/μL and was accompanied by cytokine release syndrome and dose-limiting transaminitis. Detailed peripheral blood cytokine profiling revealed elevated IL-21 levels preinfusion 2 compared with infusion 1.

Conclusion: B7-H3 CAR T cells are tolerable and demonstrate limited antitumor activity without acute on-target, off-tumor toxicity. High levels of CAR T cell expansion may be necessary to achieve objective responses, but undefined host and tumor microenvironment factors appear to be critical (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04483778).",12/10/2024,JCO.23.02229,"{'Navin Pinto': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, Eureka Therapeutics', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: I hold a patent 20210346431 that has been licensed to Umoja Biotherapeutics and may result in royalty payments.

This clinical trial aimed to clarify the preventive effect of naldemedine versus placebo for constipation in patients with cancer starting regularly dosed strong opioids therapy.

Methods: This multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, confirmatory trial was conducted between July 2021 and May 2023 at four academic hospitals in Japan (Japan Registry of Clinical Trials identifier: jRCTs031200397). Patients with cancer starting a first-time regularly dosed strong opioid for cancer pain and age 20+ years were included. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the naldemedine (Symproic 0.2 mg) or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio for 14 days with protocol treatment. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a Bowel Function Index (BFI) of <28.8 on day 14. The secondary end points included frequency of spontaneous bowel movements (SBM), quality of life (QOL), and frequency of opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV).

Results: Of the 103 patients assessed for eligibility, 99 received either naldemedine (n = 49) or placebo (n = 50). A BFI of <28.8 on day 14 was significantly more likely to occur in the naldemedine group (64.6%; 95% CI, 51.1 to 78.1) versus placebo (17.0%; 95% CI, 6.3 to 27.8), and the difference between groups was 47.6% (95% CI, 30.3 to 64.8; P < .0001).

This phase Ia/b trial determined the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of imlunestrant, as monotherapy and in combination with targeted therapy, in ER-positive (ER+) advanced breast cancer (ABC) and endometrial endometrioid cancer. The ER+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HER2–) ABC experience is reported here.

Methods: An i3+3 dose-escalation design was used, followed by dose expansions of imlunestrant as monotherapy or in combination with abemaciclib with or without aromatase inhibitor (AI), everolimus, or alpelisib. Imlunestrant was administered orally once daily and with the combination partner per label.

Results: Overall, 262 patients with ER+/HER2– ABC were treated (phase Ia, n = 74; phase Ib, n = 188). Among patients who received imlunestrant monotherapy (n = 114), no dose-limiting toxicities or discontinuations occurred. At the RP2D (400 mg once daily), patients (n = 51) reported grade 1-2 nausea (39.2%), fatigue (39.2%), and diarrhea (29.4%). Patients at RP2D had received previous cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i; 92.2%), fulvestrant (41.2%), and chemotherapy (29.4%) for ABC and achieved a median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 7.2 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 8.3). Among patients who received imlunestrant + abemaciclib (n = 42) and imlunestrant + abemaciclib + AI (n = 43), most (69.4%) were treatment-naïve for ABC; all were CDK4/6i-naïve. Patients treated with imlunestrant + everolimus (n = 42)/alpelisib (n = 21) had received previous CDK4/6i (100%), fulvestrant (34.9%), and chemotherapy (17.5%) for ABC. No new safety signals or interactions with partnered drugs were observed. The mPFS was 19.2 months (95% CI, 13.8 to not available) for imlunestrant + abemaciclib and was not reached for imlunestrant + abemaciclib + AI. The mPFS with imlunestrant + everolimus/alpelisib was 15.9 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 19.1)/9.2 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 11.1). Antitumor activity was evident regardless of ESR1 mutation status.

Methods: From March 2022 to December 2023, a randomized, blind, sham-controlled trial conducted across six Chinese hospitals investigated patients with breast cancer undergoing highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). Patients were randomly assigned to either true electroacupuncture (n = 120) or sham electroacupuncture (n = 119) groups, with both groups receiving standard triple antiemetic therapy. The primary end point was the proportion of complete protection (no vomiting, no need for rescue treatment, and no significant nausea, as evaluated using the visual analog scale [VAS]) within 120 hours after receiving HEC.

Results: Among 239 randomly assigned patients, 235 (98.3%) completed the trial. In the full analysis set, compared with the sham electroacupuncture group, the true electroacupuncture group demonstrated a significant increase in the complete protection rate from 34.5% to 52.9% (P = .004). Additionally, true electroacupuncture also showed enhanced total control (4.3% v 13.4%; P = .014), no significant nausea (37.9% v 58.8%; P = .001), no nausea (4.3% v 13.4%; P = .014), and nausea VAS score = 0 mm (4.3% v 12.6%; P = .023). However, the occurrence of no vomiting in the overall stage was similar (76.7% v 73.9%; P = .622) in both groups. Post hoc exploratory analysis showed a significantly higher rate of complete protection during the delayed stage in the true electroacupuncture group compared with the sham electroacupuncture group, with no significant difference observed during the acute stage.

Conclusion: Adding true electroacupuncture to standard triple antiemetic therapy significantly enhances the efficacy of CINV treatment in patients with breast cancer receiving HEC.",12/1/2024,JCO.24.00099,{}

Patients and Methods: Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of ≤1 and a T2-4aN0-1M0 stage with >50% urothelial carcinoma histology and were ineligible for or refused cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Patients received four cycles of nivolumab 360 mg once every 3 weeks + nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 once on days 1 and 8, every 3 weeks, followed by RC, and then adjuvant nivolumab 360 mg once every 3 weeks × 13 cycles. The primary end point was the pathologic complete response (CR) rate (ypT0N0). Secondary end points were major pathologic response (ypT≤1N0), safety, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival.

Results: Thirty-one patients were enrolled from December 2021 to June 2023; 19 (61.3%) had a cT2 stage, two (6.5%) had N1 stage, and 16 (51.6%) had a variant histology. Five patients (16.1%) received less than four full courses of neoadjuvant treatment because of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Grade 3/4 TRAEs occurred in eight patients (25.8%). Twenty-eight patients underwent RC, and three refused RC after evidence of clinical CR and received a redo transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (reTURBT). The trial met its primary end point: 10 patients (32.3%; 95% CI, 16.7 to 51.4) achieved an ypT0N0 response. By including those who underwent reTURBT, 22 (70.9%; 95% CI, 55 to 87) achieved an ypT≤1N0-x response. After a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 5-22), two patients had a disease relapse after surgery. The 12-month EFS was 89.8% (95% CI, 79.5 to 100).

Methods: Women ≥18 years of age received inavolisib, palbociclib, and letrozole (Inavo + Palbo + Letro arm) or fulvestrant (Inavo + Palbo + Fulv arm) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. The primary objective was to evaluate safety or tolerability.

Results: Fifty-three patients were included, 33 in the Inavo + Palbo + Letro arm and 20 in the Inavo + Palbo + Fulv arm. Median duration of inavolisib treatment was 15.7 and 20.8 months (cutoff: March 27, 2023), respectively. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in all patients; the most frequent were stomatitis, hyperglycemia, and diarrhea; grade ≥3 any TRAE rates were 87.9% and 85.0%; 6.1% and 10.0% discontinued any treatment due to TRAEs in the Inavo + Palbo + Letro and Inavo + Palbo + Fulv arms, respectively. No PK drug–drug interactions (DDIs) were observed among the study treatments when administered. Confirmed objective response rates were 52.0% and 40.0% in patients with measurable disease, and median progression-free survival was 23.3 and 35.0 months in the Inavo + Palbo + Letro and Inavo + Palbo + Fulv arms, respectively.

Results From First-in-Human Phase I Dose-Escalation Study of a Novel Bicycle Toxin Conjugate Targeting EphA2 (BT5528) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors,Babar  Bashir; Judy S.

EphA2 is overexpressed in many solid tumors and contributes to oncogenesis, tumor-associated angiogenesis, and metastasis.

Materials and Methods: The primary objectives were to investigate the safety and tolerability of BT5528 and to define the maximum-tolerated dose, if observed, and recommended phase II dose (RP2D)/expansion dose. Dose escalation exploring once every week or once every 2 weeks administration of BT5528 employed a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design for the first two dose levels, followed by a Bayesian logistic regression model. Secondary and exploratory end points included preliminary efficacy and the pharmacokinetics of BT5528 and MMAE.

Results: Forty-five patients were enrolled and received BT5528 doses between 2.2 mg/m2 once every week to 10.0 mg/m2 once every 2 weeks within the dose-escalation stage of the study. The most frequent BT5528-related adverse events (AEs) were nausea (44.4%), diarrhea (35.6%), and fatigue (33.3%), and the most common grade ≥3 BT5528-related AE was neutropenia/neutrophil count decrease (22.2%). Dose level 6.5 mg/m2 once every 2 weeks was selected as a RP2D. At 6.5 mg/m2 once every 2 weeks, the overall response rate was 6.7%, and the disease control rate was 20.0%. BT5528 and MMAE pharmacokinetics are generally dose proportional. BT5528 has a short half-life (0.4-0.7 hours), and the half-life of MMAE is longer (35-47 hours).

Conclusion: BT5528 was well tolerated and demonstrated favorable and preliminary antitumor activity. We believe these data provide preliminary validation of a Bicycle Toxin Conjugate approach to EphA2 tumor antigen. The study is ongoing and is evaluating BT5528 as monotherapy at a RP2D of 6.5 mg/m2 once every 2 weeks.",10/10/2024,JCO.23.01107,{}
Bladder-Preserving Trimodality Treatment for High-Grade T1 Bladder Cancer: Results From Phase II Protocol NRG Oncology/RTOG 0926,Douglas M.  Dahl; Joseph P.  Rodgers; William U.  Shipley; M.

Karrison; Howard M.  Sandler; Felix Y.  Feng; Jason A.  Efstathiou,MA; PA; PA; PA; PA; QC; GA; QC; PA; MO; NH; MD; MD; PA; CA; CA; MA,"Purpose: To investigate the use of radiation with radiosensitizing chemotherapy following repeated transurethral resection (trimodality therapy) as an alternative to radical cystectomy in T1 bladder cancer which has failed Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).

Patients and Methods: Patients with recurrent T1 bladders who had failed BCG and were recommended to undergo cystectomy were treated with trimodality therapy. The primary end point was 3-year freedom from cystectomy. Secondary end points were distant metastasis at 3 and 5 years, local recurrence, disease-specific and overall survival (OS), and safety.

Results: This single-arm phase II study enrolled 37 patients. Efficacy and safety were evaluated in 34 patients after three exclusions. The median follow-up was 5.1 years. The 3-year freedom from cystectomy rate was 88% (lower one-sided 97.5% confidence limit [CI], 72%), meeting the primary study goal. OS at 3 and 5 years was 69% (95% CI, 54 to 85) and 56% (95% CI, 39 to 74), respectively. The distant metastasis rates at 3 and 5 years were 12% (95% CI, 4 to 26) and 19% (95% CI, 7 to 34), respectively. Eight patients died due to urothelial cancer, 12 exhibited local recurrence at 3 years (cumulative incidence: 32%; 95% CI, 17 to 48), 18 experienced grade 3 adverse events, mostly hematological, and one developed grade 4 neutropenia.

Conclusion: Trimodality therapy is an effective potential alternative to radical cystectomy for recurrent high-grade T1 urothelial cancer of the bladder. At 3 years, 88% of the patients remained free of cystectomy.",12/1/2024,JCO.23.02510,"{'Douglas M.

The controversy is mainly regarding the survival benefit from extended lymph node dissection emphasized by CME.

Methods: This multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02619942) was performed across 17 hospitals in China. Patients diagnosed with stage T2-T4aNanyM0 or TanyN + M0 right-sided colon cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo either CME or D2 dissection during laparoscopic right colectomy. The primary outcome was the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS), and the main secondary outcome was the 3-year overall survival (OS).

Results: Between January 11, 2016, and December 26, 2019, 1,072 patients were randomly assigned (536 patients to CME and 536 patients to D2 dissection). In total, 995 patients (median age 61 years, 59% male) were included in the primary analysis (CME [n = 495] v D2 dissection [n = 500]). No significant differences were found between the groups in 3-year DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74 [95% CI, 0.54 to 1.02]; P = .06; 86.1% in the CME group v 81.9% in the D2 group) or in 3-year OS (HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.43 to 1.16]; P = .17; 94.7% in the CME group v 92.6% in the D2 group).

Conclusion: This trial failed to find evidence of superior DFS outcome for CME compared with standard D2 lymph node dissection in primary surgical excision of right-sided colon cancer. Standard D2 dissection should be the routine procedure for these patients. CME should only be considered in patients with obvious mesocolic lymph node involvement.",11/20/2024,JCO.24.00393,{}

However, the efficacy of adding OX to FP plus BEV (FP + BEV) remains unclear for older patients, a population for whom FP + BEV is standard. We aimed to confirm the superiority of adding OX to FP + BEV for this population.

Methods: This open-label, randomized, phase III trial was conducted at 42 institutions in Japan. Patients with unresectable MCRC age 70-74 years with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS) 2 and those 75 years and older with ECOG-PS 0-2 were randomly assigned (1:1) to an FP + BEV arm or an OX addition (FP + BEV + OX) arm. Fluorouracil plus levofolinate calcium or capecitabine was declared before enrollment. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). The study was registered in the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (identifier: jRCTs031180145).

Results: Between September 2012 and March 2019, 251 patients were randomly assigned to the FP + BEV arm (n = 125) and the FP + BEV + OX arm (n = 126). The median age was 80 and 79 years in the respective arm. The median PFS was 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.3 to 10.3) in the FP + BEV arm and 10.0 months (9.0 to 11.2) in the FP + BEV + OX arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84 [90.5% CI, 0.67 to 1.04]; one-sided P = .086). The median overall survival was 21.3 months (18.7 to 24.3) in the FP + BEV arm and 19.7 months (15.5 to 25.5) in the FP + BEV + OX arm (HR, 1.05 [0.81 to 1.37]). The proportion of any grade ≥3 adverse events was higher in the FP + BEV + OX arm (52% v 69%). There was one treatment-related death in the FP + BEV arm and three in the FP + BEV + OX arm.

Conclusion: No benefit of adding OX to FP + BEV as first-line treatment was demonstrated in older patients with MCRC. FP + BEV is recommended for this population.",11/20/2024,JCO.23.02722,{}
TROPHY-U-01 Cohort 2: A Phase II Study of Sacituzumab Govitecan in Cisplatin-Ineligible Patients With Metastatic Urothelial Cancer Progressing After Previous Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy,Daniel P.

Here, we report results from Cohort 2 of TROPHY-U-01 trial, evaluating the efficacy and safety of SG in patients with mUC.

Methods: TROPHY-U-01 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03547973) is a multicohort, open-label phase II study. Cohort 2 includes patients with LA or mUC who have had progression or recurrence after a CPI and were cisplatin-ineligible at study initiation. Patients received SG 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per central review; secondary end points were clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival (PFS) per central review and safety.

Results: Cohort 2 included 38 patients (61% male; median age 72.5 years; 66% visceral metastases [29% liver]; 50% received previous PT-based chemotherapy as previous [neo]adjuvant therapy]). At a median follow-up of 9.3 months, ORR was 32% (95% CI, 17.5 to 48.7), CBR 42% (95% CI, 26.3 to 59.2), median DOR 5.6 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 13.3), median PFS 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 8.3), and median overall survival 13.5 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 15.6). Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 87% of patients, most commonly neutropenia (34%), anemia (24%), leukopenia (19%), fatigue (18%), and diarrhea (16%).

Conclusion: SG monotherapy demonstrated a relatively high ORR with rapid responses; this was feasible with a manageable toxicity profile in cisplatin-ineligible patients who had progression after CPI therapy. Limitations include a moderate sample size and lack of random assignment. These results warrant further evaluation of SG alone and in combinations in patients with LA/mUC.",10/10/2024,JCO.23.01720,"{'Daniel P.

We report results from the randomized, double-blind, phase III KEYNOTE-789 study of pemetrexed and platinum–based chemotherapy with or without pembrolizumab for TKI-resistant, EGFR-mutant, metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03515837).

Methods: Adults with pathologically confirmed stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC, documented DEL19 or L858R EGFR mutation, and progression after EGFR-TKI treatment were randomly assigned 1:1 to 35 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo once every 3 weeks plus four cycles of pemetrexed and carboplatin or cisplatin once every 3 weeks and then maintenance pemetrexed. Dual primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Final PFS testing was completed at the second interim analysis (IA2; data cutoff, December 3, 2021); OS was tested at final analysis (FA; data cutoff, January 17, 2023). Efficacy boundaries were one-sided P = .0117 for PFS and OS.

Results: Four hundred ninety-two patients were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n = 245) or placebo plus chemotherapy (n = 247). At IA2, the median PFS was 5.6 months for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus 5.5 months for placebo plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97]; P = .0122). At FA, the median OS was 15.9 versus 14.7 months, respectively (HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.02]; P = .0362). Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 43.7% of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy recipients versus 38.6% of placebo plus chemotherapy recipients.

Therefore, we assessed the long-term influence of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and CEE-alone on ovarian and endometrial cancer incidence and mortality in the Women's Health Initiative randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Materials and Methods: Postmenopausal women, age 50-79 years, were entered on two randomized clinical trials evaluating different menopausal hormone therapy regimens. In 16,608 women with a uterus, 8,506 were randomly assigned to once daily 0.625 mg of CEE plus 2.5 mg once daily of MPA and 8,102 placebo. In 10,739 women with previous hysterectomy, 5,310 were randomly assigned to once daily 0.625 mg of CEE-alone and 5,429 placebo. Intervention was stopped for cause before planned 8.5-year intervention after 5.6 years (CEE plus MPA) and after 7.2 years (CEE-alone). Outcomes include incidence and mortality from ovarian and endometrial cancers and deaths after these cancers.

Results: After 20-year follow-up, CEE-alone, versus placebo, significantly increased ovarian cancer incidence (35 cases [0.041%] v 17 [0.020%]; hazard ratio [HR], 2.04 [95% CI, 1.14 to 3.65]; P = .014) and ovarian cancer mortality (P = .006). By contrast, CEE plus MPA, versus placebo, did not increase ovarian cancer incidence (75 cases [0.051%] v 63 [0.045%]; HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.59]; P = .44) or ovarian cancer mortality but did significantly lower endometrial cancer incidence (106 cases [0.073%] v 140 [0.10%]; HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.56 to 0.92]; P = .01).

Conclusion: In randomized clinical trials, CEE-alone increased ovarian cancer incidence and ovarian cancer mortality, while CEE plus MPA did not. By contrast, CEE plus MPA significantly reduced endometrial cancer incidence.",10/20/2024,JCO.23.01918,"{'Rowan T.

Patients and Methods: Approval was based on CAPItello-291, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial of 708 patients with hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative advanced or MBC, including 289 patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN tumor alterations. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive capivasertib 400 mg twice daily for 4 days per week with fulvestrant versus placebo with fulvestrant. Random assignment was stratified by presence of liver metastases, previous treatment with CDK4/6i, cyclin-dependent kinase four and six (CDK4/6) inhibitors, and geographical region.

Results: A statistically significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit was demonstrated in the overall population (hazard ratio [HR], 0.6 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.71]); this result was driven by 289 patients in the biomarker-positive population (HR, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68]). An exploratory analysis of investigator-assessed PFS in the 313 (44%) patients in the biomarker-negative population showed uncertain benefit (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.01]). With capivasertib, more patients had Grade ≥3 toxicities. Key concerns included hyperglycemia (18% all-grade, 2.8% Grade ≥3), cutaneous toxicity (58% all-grade, 17% Grade ≥3), and diarrhea (72% all-grade, 9% Grade ≥3).

Conclusion: Capivasertib with fulvestrant was approved for patients whose tumors harbored PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations. Benefit-risk assessment in this subgroup was favorable based on a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS in the context of an acceptable safety profile including no evidence of a potential detriment in overall survival. By contrast, the benefit-risk was unfavorable in the biomarker-negative population.",12/1/2024,JCO.24.00427,"{'Asma Dilawari': ['Honoraria: Reimagine Care LLC'], 'James Buturla': ['Employment: Treatment and Learning Centers, University of California- San Diego'], 'Francisca Reyes Turcu': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: MCRA']}"

Methods: The IELSG37 trial, a randomized noninferiority study, aimed to assess whether irradiation can be omitted in patients with PMBCL with complete metabolic response (CMR) after induction immunochemotherapy. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 30 months after random assignment. Patients with CMR were randomly assigned to observation or consolidation radiotherapy (30 Gy). With a noninferiority margin of 10% (assuming a 30-month PFS of 85% in both arms), a sample size of 540 patients was planned with 376 expected to be randomly assigned.

Results: The observed events were considerably lower than expected; therefore, primary end point analysis was conducted when ≥95% of patients were followed for ≥30 months. Of the 545 patients enrolled, 268 were in CMR after induction and were randomly assigned to observation (n = 132) or radiotherapy (n = 136). The 30-month PFS was 96.2% in the observation arm and 98.5% in the radiotherapy arm, with a stratified hazard ratio of 1.47 (95% CI, 0.34 to 6.28) and absolute risk difference of 0.68% (95% CI, –0.97 to 7.46). The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 99% in both arms. Nonrandomized patients were managed according to local policies. Radiotherapy was the only treatment in 86% of those with Deauville score (DS) 4 and in 57% of those with DS 5. The 5-year PFS and OS of patients with DS 4 (95.8% and 97.5%, respectively) were not significantly different from those of randomly assigned patients. Patients with DS5 had significantly poorer 5-year PFS and OS (60.3% and 74.6%, respectively).

Conclusion: This study, the largest randomized trial of radiotherapy in PMBCL, demonstrated favorable outcomes in patients achieving CMR with no survival impairment for those omitting irradiation.",12/1/2024,JCO-24-01373,"{'Maurizio Martelli': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Gilead Sciences, Novartis, Abbvie, Incyte, BeiGene, Takeda, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene'], 'Iryna Kriachok': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen, AstraZeneca, Abbvie, Takeda, Roche, Merck', ""Speakers' Bureau: AstraZeneca, Abbvie, Takeda, Roche"", 'Research Funding: Janssen, Bayer, Karyopharm Therapeutics, MSD, Acerta Pharma, Abbvie, Debiopharm Group, Acerta Pharma, Merck, Bayer, InnoCarePharm, Chromos Pharma, Pharmacyclics', 'Expert Testimony: Takeda, Janssen, AstraZeneca, Takeda', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Takeda, MSD, Abbvie, Roche'], 'Monica Balzarotti': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Lilly, Gilead Sciences, Abbvie, AstraZeneca', ""Speakers' Bureau: Roche, Lilly, Gilead Sciences, SOBI"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche, BeiGene Beijing'], 'Alessandra Tucci': ['Honoraria: Kyowa Kirin International, MDS Foundation', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen, Takeda, Gentili, Sanofi', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: sandoz'], 'Vittorio Ruggero Zilioli': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Kite, a Gilead company, Roche, Takeda', ""Speakers' Bureau: Lilly, Janssen, Takeda"", 'Research Funding: Kite/Gilead (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, BeiGene, Roche'], 'Luca Arcaini': ['Honoraria: Eusa Pharma, Novartis/Ipsen', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Janssen-Cilag, Incyte, EUSA Pharma, Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb, Kite/Gilead, ADC Therapeutics, Kite/Gilead, Novartis', ""Speakers' Bureau: EUSA Pharma, Novartis"", 'Research Funding: Gilead Sciences', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche, Celgene, Janssen-Cilag, Eusa Pharma'], 'Anna Dabrowska-Iwanicka': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Gilead Sciences, Abbvie'], 'Andrés J.M.

Here, we report results of the prespecified combined analysis including the initial phase II and subsequent phase III components.

Patients and Methods: Study treatment consisted of oral capsules containing either tetrahydrocannabinol 2.5 mg plus cannabidiol 2.5 mg capsules (THC:CBD) or matching placebo, taken three times a day from days –1 to 5, in addition to guideline-consistent antiemetics. The primary measure of effect was the difference in the proportions of participants with no vomiting or retching and no use of rescue medications (a complete response) during hours 0-120 after the first cycle of chemotherapy on study (cycle A).

Results: We recruited 147 evaluable of a planned 250 participants from 2016 to 2022. Background antiemetic prophylaxis included a corticosteroid and 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonist in 97%, a neurokinin-1 antagonist in 80%, and olanzapine in 10%. THC:CBD compared with placebo improved the complete response rate from 8% to 24% (absolute difference 16%, 95% CI, 4 to 28, P = .01), with similar effects for absence of significant nausea, use of rescue medications, daily vomits, and the nausea scale on the Functional Living Index—Emesis quality-of-life questionnaire. More frequent bothersome adverse events of special interest included sedation (18% v 7%), dizziness (10% v 0%), and transient anxiety (4% v 1%). There were no serious adverse events attributed to THC:CBD.

Conclusion: THC:CBD is an effective adjunct for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting despite standard antiemetic prophylaxis, but was associated with additional adverse events. Drug availability, cultural attitudes, legal status, and preferences may affect implementation. Future analyses will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of THC:CBD.",12/1/2024,JCO.23.01836,{}

Lee,NE; NE; NE; OH; OH; NE; NE; NE; NE; NE; NE; NE; FL; WA,"Purpose: Sclerotic chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) represents a highly morbid and refractory form of cGVHD, and novel therapies for sclerotic cGVHD are critically needed. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients with corticosteroid refractory sclerotic cGVHD.

Patients and Methods: In a single-arm multicenter phase II trial (N = 47), adults with sclerotic cGVHD refractory to corticosteroids and ≥one additional line of systemic therapy for cGVHD received ruxolitinib for ≥six months (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03616184). The primary end point was complete or partial response (PR) in skin and/or joint defined according to the 2014 National Institute of Health cGVHD Consensus Criteria.

Results: Following the use of ruxolitinib for a median of 11 months, PR in skin and/or joints was noted in 49% (95% CI, 34 to 64) at 6 months, with 45% having joint and fascia response and 19% having skin response. The duration of skin/joint response was 77% (95% CI, 48 to 91) at 12 months. Overall cGVHD PR was noted in 47% (95% CI, 32 to 61). Improvement in Lee Symptom Scale summary and skin subscale scores was noted in 38% of patients. With a cumulative incidence of treatment failure of 20.8% (95% CI, 10.0 to 34.1), nonrelapse mortality (NRM) of 2.2% (95% CI, 0.17 to 10.3), and no recurrent malignancy, failure-free survival (FFS) was 77.1% (95% CI, 61.3 to 87.0) at 12 months. Ruxolitinib was overall well tolerated with no new safety signals.

Conclusion: The use of ruxolitinib was associated with relatively high rates of skin/joint responses and overall cGVHD responses, improvement in patient-reported outcomes, low NRM, and high FFS in patients with refractory sclerotic cGVHD. Ruxolitinib offers an effective treatment option for refractory sclerotic cGVHD.",11/20/2024,JCO.24.00205,{}

Methods: AUGMENT-101 is a phase I/II, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study of revumenib conducted across 22 clinical sites in five countries (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04065399). We report results from the phase II, registration-enabling portion. Individuals age ≥30 days with R/R KMT2Ar acute leukemia or with AML and nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutation were enrolled. Revumenib was administered once every 12 hours, at 163 mg (95 mg/m2 if weight <40 kg) with a strong cytochrome P450 inhibitor, in 28-day cycles. The primary end points were the rate of complete remission (CR) or CR with partial hematologic recovery (CR + CRh) and safety. At a prespecified interim analysis, safety was assessed in all KMT2Ar treated patients; efficacy was assessed in those with centrally confirmed KMT2Ar. The separate NPM1 cohort of the trial is ongoing.

Results: From October 1, 2021, to July 24, 2023, N = 94 patients (median [range] age, 37 [1.3-75] years) were treated. Grade ≥3 adverse events included febrile neutropenia (37.2%), differentiation syndrome (16.0%), and QTc prolongation (13.8%). In the efficacy-evaluable patients (n = 57), the CR + CRh rate was 22.8% (95% CI, 12.7 to 35.8), exceeding the null hypothesis of 10% (P = .0036). Overall response rate was 63.2% (95% CI, 49.3 to 75.6), with 15 of 22 patients (68.2%) having no detectable residual disease.

Conclusion: Revumenib led to high remission rates with a predictable safety profile in R/R KMT2Ar acute leukemia. To our knowledge, this trial represents the largest evaluation of a targeted therapy for these patients.",1/1/2025,JCO.24.00826,"{'Ghayas C.

In addition, the significance of anti–human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy in HER2-expressing BTC has not been sufficiently investigated.

Methods: In this phase II trial, participants from five institutions in Japan were enrolled. Eligible patients had pathologically confirmed unresectable or recurrent BTC with centrally confirmed HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC]3+ or IHC2+ and in situ hybridization [ISH]+) or HER2-low (IHC2+ and ISH–, IHC1+, and IHC0 and ISH+) and were refractory or intolerant to a gemcitabine-containing regimen. The patients received 5.4 mg/kg trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) once every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) in HER2-positive BTC by an independent central review (threshold ORR, 15%; expected ORR, 40%).

Results: A total of 32 patients were enrolled and treated. Among these patients, 22 with HER2-positive disease comprised the primary efficacy population and had a confirmed ORR of 36.4% (90% CI, 19.6 to 56.1; P = .01), meeting the primary end point. Eight with HER2-low disease comprised the exploratory population and had a confirmed ORR of 12.5%. The most common ≥grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were anemia (53.1%) and neutropenia (31.3%). Eight patients (25.0%) had interstitial lung disease (ILD), including two grade 5 events.

Conclusion: T-DXd showed promising activity in patients with HER2-positive BTC and a signal of efficacy in patients with HER2-low BTC.

There is limited prospective evidence for maintenance strategies after chemotherapy.

Methods: This investigator-initiated, open-label, randomized, integrated phase II-III study enrolled adult patients with advanced BTC from two cancer centers in India. Patients with histologically confirmed advanced biliary tract adenocarcinoma who had at least disease stabilization after 6 months of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned (1:1) to either active surveillance or switch maintenance, which was a combination of bevacizumab 5 mg/kg intravenous once every 21 days plus erlotinib 100 mg once daily. Both arms were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient decision to withdraw. The primary end point of the phase II component of the trial was investigator-evaluated progression-free survival. This trial is registered with Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2019/05/019323I).

Results: From May 2021 to November 2022, 98 patients were randomly assigned to active surveillance (n = 49) or bevacizumab-erlotinib (n = 49). A majority of patients had gallbladder cancer (80%). The median follow-up was 13.4 months. The median progression-free survival was 3.1 months (95% CI, 2.47 to 3.64) in the active surveillance group versus 5.3 months (95% CI, 3.53 to 7.04) in the bevacizumab-erlotinib group (hazard ratio, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0·74]; P = .0013). The most common grade 3 class-specific adverse events associated with bevacizumab-erlotinib were acneiform rash 1 (2%) and oral stomatitis 1 (2%) with erlotinib and bleeding 1 (2%) with bevacizumab.

Conclusion: The combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib as switch maintenance improves progression-free survival with an acceptable safety profile compared with active surveillance in patients with advanced BTCs in this phase II study.

Here, we investigate progression-free survival (PFS) and OS after postrecurrence systemic therapy.

Patients and Methods: Patients 15 years or older with resected stage IIIB-C/IV melanoma were stratified by stage and tumor PD-L1 status and randomly assigned to receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or ipilimumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses and then every 12 weeks for 1 year or until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Patients with recurrence in each group were assessed for PFS and OS from subsequent systemic therapy (SST) initiation per recurrence timing (≤12 months [early] v >12 months [late] from initial therapy).

Results: Recurrences occurred in 198 (44%) of 453 nivolumab-treated patients (122 early, 76 late) and 232 (51%) of 453 ipilimumab-treated patients (160 early, 72 late). Median PFS on next-line systemic therapy for nivolumab-treated patients recurring early versus late was 4.7 versus 12.4 months (24-month rates, 16% v 31%); median OS was 19.8 versus 42.8 months (24-month rates: 37% v 73%). In response to subsequent therapy, patients on nivolumab with late versus early recurrence were more likely to benefit from anti–PD-1 monotherapy. Nivolumab-treated patients with either an early or late recurrence benefitted from an ipilimumab-based therapy or targeted therapy, each with similar OS.

Conclusion: Postrecurrence survival was longer for patients who recurred >12 months.

Methods: EXTEND (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03599765) is a multicenter, phase II basket trial randomly assigning patients with ≤five metastases 1:1 to MDT plus systemic therapy versus systemic therapy. Disease progression was defined by radiologic criteria (RECIST v1.1), clinical progression, or death. The primary end point was PFS in the per-protocol population, evaluated after all patients achieved at least 6 months of follow-up. Exploratory end points included systemic immune response measures.

Results: Between March 19, 2019, and February 13, 2023, 41 patients were randomly assigned and 40 were eligible for the primary analysis of PFS (19 patients in the MDT arm; 21 patients in the control arm). At a median follow-up time of 17 months, the median PFS time was 10.3 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 14.0) in the MDT arm versus 2.5 months (95% CI, 1.7 to 5.1) in the control arm. PFS was significantly improved by the addition of MDT to systemic therapy (P = .030 for stratified log-rank test) with a hazard ratio of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.94). No grade ≥3 or greater adverse events related to MDT were observed. Systemic immune activation events were associated with MDT and correlated with improved PFS.

Conclusion: This study supports the addition of MDT to systemic therapy for patients with oligometastatic PDAC. Induction of systemic immunity is a possible mechanism of benefit. These results warrant confirmatory trials to refine treatment strategy and provide external validation.",11/10/2024,JCO.24.00081,"{'Ethan B.

Patients and Methods: Patients exhibited advanced solid tumors with HER2 amplification that was identified via next-generation sequencing of cfDNA testing, without the requirement for immunohistochemical HER2 testing. The studied group was administered T-DXd at 5.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks until onset of disease progression or intolerable toxicity.

Results: Overall, 4,734 patients underwent cfDNA testing from December 2019 to January 2022, and 252 demonstrated HER2 amplification. Finally, the study included 62 patients with 16 cancer types with a median baseline plasma HER2 copy number (CN) of 8.55 (range, 2.4-73.9). Confirmed overall response rate (ORR) by investigator assessment was 56.5% (95% CI, 43.3 to 69.0), thus showing a value beyond the 5% threshold. Responses were evaluated for 13 cancer types, including KRAS-mutant colorectal (1/3), PIK3CA-mutant endometrial (5/6), and tissue HER2-negative gastric (1/2) cancers. Plasma HER2 CN above versus below the baseline median value did not differ for impact response; however, clearance of HER2 amplification in cfDNA on cycle 2 day 1 had higher response values compared with persistence. Median progression-free survival and response duration were 7.0 (95% CI, 4.9 to 9.7) and 8.8 (95% CI, 5.8 to 11.2) months, respectively, with the majority of complications being mild to moderate. Interstitial lung diseases were identified in 16 (26%) patients, including 14 patients with grade 1 disease, one patient with grade 2 disease, and one patient with grade 3 disease.

Conclusion: T-DXd treatment demonstrated high ORR with durable response in patients with advanced HER2-amplified solid tumors determined with cfDNA testing.",11/10/2024,JCO.23.02626,"{'Masataka

Fluorouarcil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and leucovorin (FFX) is a standard first-line therapy for mPC for patients with a favorable performance status and good organ function. In a phase I study, devimistat (CPI-613) in combination with modified FFX (mFFX) was deemed safe and exhibited promising efficacy in mPC.

Methods: The AVENGER 500 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03504423) is a global, randomized phase III trial conducted at 74 sites across six countries to investigate the efficacy and safety of devimistat in combination with mFFX (experimental arm) compared with standard-dose FFX (control arm) in treatment-naïve patients with mPC. Treatment, administered in once-every-2-weeks cycles until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, included intravenous devimistat at 500 mg/m2 total per day on days 1 and 3 in the experimental arm. The primary end point of the study was overall survival (OS).

Results: Five hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned (266 in the experimental arm and 262 in the control arm). The median OS was 11.10 months for devimistat plus mFFX versus 11.73 months for FFX (hazard ratio [HR], 0.95 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.18]; P = .655) and median progression-free survival was 7.8 months versus 8.0 months, respectively (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.29]; P = .94). Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events with >10% frequency in the devimistat plus mFFX arm versus the FFX arm were neutropenia (29.0% v 34.5%), diarrhea (11.2% v 19.6%), hypokalemia (13.1% v 14.9%), anemia (13.9% v 13.6%), thrombocytopenia (11.6% v 13.6%), and fatigue (10.8% v 11.5%), respectively.

Conclusion: Devimistat in combination with mFFX did not improve long- and short-term mPC patient outcomes compared with standard FFX. There were no new toxicity signals with the addition of devimistat.",11/1/2024,JCO.23.02659,"{'Philip A.

We examined the efficacy of a nurse-led brief behavioral intervention to improve dyspnea in patients with advanced lung cancer.

Methods: Patients with advanced lung cancer reporting at least moderate breathlessness (n = 247) were enrolled in a randomized trial of a nurse-led two-session intervention (focused on breathing techniques, postural positions, and fan therapy) versus usual care. At baseline and weeks 8 (primary end point), 16, and 24, participants completed measures of dyspnea (Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale [mMRCDS]; Cancer Dyspnoea Scale [CDS]), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung [FACT-L]), psychological symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and activity level (Godin-Shephard Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire). To examine intervention effects, we conducted analysis of covariance and longitudinal mixed effects models.

Results: The sample (Agemean = 66.15 years; 55.9% female) primarily included patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer (85.4%). Compared with usual care, the intervention improved the primary outcome of patient-reported dyspnea on the mMRCDS (difference = –0.33 [95% CI, –0.61 to –0.05]) but not the CDS total score at 8 weeks. Intervention patients also reported less dyspnea on the CDS sense of discomfort subscale (difference = –0.59 [95% CI, –1.16 to –0.01]) and better functional well-being per the FACT-L (difference = 1.39 [95% CI, 0.18 to 2.59]) versus the control group. Study groups did not differ in overall quality of life, psychological symptoms, or activity level at 8 weeks or longitudinally over 24 weeks.

Conclusion: For patients with advanced lung cancer, a scalable behavioral intervention alleviated the intractable symptom of dyspnea. Further research is needed on ways to enhance intervention effects over the long-term and across additional outcomes.",10/20/2024,JCO.24.00048,"{'Joseph A.

We report efficacy and safety of sacituzumab govitecan (SG), a trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2)–directed antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with advanced EC.

Methods: TROPiCS-03 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03964727) is a multicohort, open-label, phase II basket study in patients with metastatic solid tumors. Eligible patients in the EC cohort received SG 10 mg/kg once on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) by investigator's assessment per RECIST v1.1. Secondary end points included clinical benefit rate (CBR; complete and partial response, and stable disease ≥6 months), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free survival (PFS) per investigator assessment, overall survival, and safety. Trop-2 expression of archival or baseline tumor specimens was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.

Results: At data extraction date, 41 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 5.8 months (range, 0.7-19.3); median previous therapies was three (range, 1-6); and 85% of patients received previous chemotherapy and immunotherapy. ORR was 22% (95% CI, 11 to 38); CBR was 32% (95% CI, 18 to 48). Median DOR was 8.8 months (95% CI, 2.8 to not estimable); median PFS was 4.8 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 9.8). Trop-2 exploratory analysis was conducted retrospectively for 39 patients. Tumor Trop-2 protein was highly expressed in EC, showing limited correlation with efficacy. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 73% of patients. Study drug discontinuation due to TRAEs was 5%. Two deaths occurred, deemed unrelated to SG.

Conclusion: Findings from TROPiCS-03 showed encouraging efficacy of SG with a manageable toxicity profile in a heavily pretreated population with advanced EC.

Their value as predictors of benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy is uncertain.

Patients and Methods: Tumor tissue from 868 patients in the QUASAR trial (adjuvant fluorouracil/folinic acid v observation in stage II/III CRC) was analyzed by CD3 and CD8 immunohistochemistry. Pathologists, assisted by artificial intelligence, calculated CD3 and CD8 cell densities (cells/mm2) in the core tumor (CT) and invasive margin (IM). Participants were randomly partitioned into training and validation sets. The primary outcome was recurrence-free interval (RFI), 2-year RFI for assessment of biomarker-treatment interactions. Maximum-likelihood methods identified optimal high-risk/low-risk group cutpoints in the training set. Prognostic analyses were repeated in the validation set.

Results: In the training set, the recurrence rate in the high-risk group was twice that in the low-risk group for all measures (CD3-CT: rate ratio [RR], 2.00, P = .0008; CD3-IM: 2.38, P < .00001; CD8-CT: 2.17, P = .0001; CD8-IM: 2.13, P = .0001). This was closely replicated in the validation set (RR, 1.96, 1.79, 1.72, 1.72, respectively). In multivariate analyses, prognostic effects were similar in colon and rectal cancers, and in stage II and III disease. Proportional reductions in recurrence with adjuvant chemotherapy were of similar magnitude in the high- and low-recurrence risk groups. Combining information from CD3-IM and CD3-CT (CD3 Score) generated high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups with numbers needed to treat (NNTs) to prevent one disease recurrence being 11, 21, and 36, respectively.

Conclusion: Recurrence rates in the high-risk CD3/CD8 groups are twice those in the low-risk groups. Proportional reductions with chemotherapy are similar, allowing NNTs derived in QUASAR to be updated using contemporary, nonrandomized data sets.",10/10/2024,JCO.23.02030,"{'Christopher J.M.

Methods: This multicenter, multicohort, open-label, single-arm, phase II trial enrolled patients with c-Met dysregulated, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC from January 2020 to August 2022 across 17 centers. Cohort 1 included patients with MET exon 14 skipping (METex14)–mutant NSCLC who had not previously received MET inhibitors. Participants were administered vebreltinib at a dosage of 200 mg twice a day in 28-day cycles. The primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR), and the key secondary end point was the duration of response (DoR), both evaluated by a blinded independent review committee according to the RECIST version 1.1.

Results: As of August 9, 2022, 52 patients had been enrolled in cohort 1, of whom 35 (67.3%) were treatment-naïve. The ORR reached 75% (95% CI, 61.1 to 86). Among treatment-naïve patients, the ORR was 77.1% (95% CI, 59.9 to 89.6), and in previously treated patients, it was 70.6% (95% CI, 44.0 to 89.7). The disease control rate was 96.2%, with a median DoR of 15.9 months, a median progression-free survival of 14.1 months, and a median overall survival of 20.7 months. The most common treatment-related adverse events were peripheral edema (82.7%), QT prolongation (30.8%), and elevated serum creatinine (28.8%).

Conclusion: Vebreltinib has shown promising efficacy and a favorable safety profile in patients with METex14-mutant NSCLC.",11/1/2024,JCO.23.02363,"{'Lin Wu': [""Speakers' Bureau: MSD, AstraZeneca, Roche China, Bristol Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Lilly, Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Hengrui Medicine""], 'Zhe-Hai Wang': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Hansoh Pharma', 'Research Funding: Hansoh Pharma (Inst)'], 'Yong Song': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Hansoh Pharma', 'Research Funding: Hansoh Pharma (Inst)'], 'He-Peng Shi': ['Employment: Beijing Pearl Biotechnology Co, Ltd', 'Leadership: Beijing Pearl Biotechnology Co, Ltd', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Beijing Pearl Biotechnology Co, Ltd'], 'Wei-Zhe Xue': ['Employment: Beijing Pearl Biotechnology Co, Ltd', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Beijing Pearl Biotechnology Co, Ltd'], 'Di Han': ['Employment: Beijing Pearl Biotechnology Co, Ltd', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Beijing Pearl Biotechnology Co, Ltd'], 'Pei-Long Zhang': ['Employment: Beijing Pearl Biotechnology Co, Ltd', 'Leadership: Beijing Pearl Biotechnology Co, Ltd', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Beijing Pearl Biotechnology Co, Ltd'], 'Yi-Long Wu': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Roche, Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim, MSD Oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb/China, Hengrui Pharmaceutical, BeiGene Beijing', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, Takeda', 'Research Funding: Boehringer Ingelheim (Inst), Roche (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), BMS (Inst)']}"
Longitudinal Health-Related Quality of Life Among Patients With High-Risk Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma Treated on the Children's Oncology Group AHOD 1331 Study,AnnaLynn M.

Parsons,NY; MA; FL; IL; GA; Canada; NY; GA; MA,"Purpose: There have been no previous longitudinal assessments of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during treatment for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The addition of brentuximab vedotin (BV) to a multidrug chemotherapy backbone demonstrated superior efficacy to standard chemotherapy for patients with pediatric high-risk HL in the AHOD 1331 trial. However, the impact on HRQoL is unknown.

Patients and Methods: After treatment random assignment, 268 participants older than 11 years were enrolled in a prespecified, longitudinal, patient-reported outcomes substudy. HRQoL was assessed using the seven-item Child Health Ratings Inventories (CHRIs)–Global scale before treatment (T1) and at cycle 2 (T2), cycle 5 (T3), and end of treatment (T4). A clinically meaningful increase in HRQoL was considered 7 points on the CHRIs-Global. Multivariable linear regression estimated associations between demographic/clinical variables and HRQoL at T1. Linear mixed models estimated changes in HRQoL across the treatment arm.

Results: Participant characteristics were balanced by treatment arm. Ninety-three percent of participants completed the CHRIs at T1, 92% at T2, 89% at T3, and 77% at T4. At T1, female sex and fever (P < .05) were each associated with worse HRQoL. By T2, participants in the BV arm experienced a statistically and clinically significant improvement in HRQoL (β = 7.3 [95% CI, 3.2 to 11.4]; P ≤ .001), which was greater than the change in the standard arm (difference in change β = 5.1 [95% CI, −0.2 to 10.3]; P = .057). The standard arm did not experience a statistically or clinically significant increase in HRQoL until T4 (β = 9.3 [95% CI, 4.7 to 11.5]; P < .001).

Conclusion: These data demonstrate successful collection of serial HRQoL from youth with high-risk pediatric HL and improvement in HRQoL over the course of initial therapy, sooner and to a greater extent in the group receiving the novel agent BV.",10/1/2024,JCO.24.00038,"{'Tara O.

This study examined MP in predicting extended letrozole therapy (ELT) benefit in patients with early-stage breast cancer (BC) from the NSABP B-42 trial.

Patients and Methods: MP was tested in 1,866 patients randomly assigned to receive ELT or placebo. The primary end point was distant recurrence (DR). Secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and BC-free interval (BCFI). Tumors were classified as MP high risk (MP-HR) or low risk (MP-LR). MP-LR tumors were further classified as ultralow risk (MP-UL) or low non-ultralow risk (MP-LNUL).

Results: There was no statistically significant difference in ELT benefit on DR between MP-HR and MP-LR (interaction P = .38). MP-LR tumors (n = 1,160) exhibited a statistically significant 10-year benefit of 3.7% for DR (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43 [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.74]; P = .002), whereas MP-HR tumors (n = 706) exhibited a nonsignificant 2.4% benefit (HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.34 to 1.24]; P = .19). The 10-year ELT benefit was significant for DFS (7.8%) and BCFI (7.0%) for MP-LR tumors, whereas MP-HR tumors did not significantly benefit (interaction DFS: P = .015, BCFI: P = .006). In exploratory analysis, the 10-year ELT benefit was significant and more pronounced in MP-LNUL (n = 908) tumors: 4.0% for DR, 9.5% for DFS, and 7.9% for BCFI; the benefit in MP-UL (n = 252) tumors was not significant: 3% for DR, 1.8% for DFS, and 4.1% for BCFI.

Conclusion: The primary hypothesis of predictive ability of MP on DR was not confirmed. However, the secondary outcomes demonstrated MP was predictive of ELT response and identified a subset of patients with early-stage hormone receptor–positive BC (MP-LR) with improved outcomes from ELT.

However, FU is associated with potential challenges (continuous 4-day infusion, high administration costs, and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicities), creating a clinical need for alternative chemotherapy combinations. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of first-line pembrolizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel for R/M HNSCC in the open-label, single-arm, phase IV KEYNOTE-B10 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04489888).

Methods: Eligible adults had previously untreated, histologically or cytologically confirmed R/M HNSCC regardless of PD-L1 status, measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR), and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for ≤35 cycles and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously once every 3 weeks for ≤6 cycles and investigator's choice of paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 or 175 mg/m2 on day 1, intravenously once every 3 weeks. The primary end point was objective response rate per RECIST v1.1 by BICR.

Results: Between October 27, 2020, and April 29, 2022, 149 patients were screened and 101 received treatment. As of February 20, 2023, the median follow-up was 18.9 months (range, 9.1-27.0). At this final analysis, 49 (49%) of 101 patients had an objective response (95% CI, 38.4 to 58.7), including seven patients (7%) with a confirmed complete response. Of the 101 treated patients, grade 3-5 and serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 76 (75%) and 27 (27%), respectively. There were no new safety signals.

Conclusion: Pembrolizumab plus carboplatin and paclitaxel showed promising antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in first-line R/M HNSCC, suggesting this combination may be an alternative option for this patient population.",9/1/2024,JCO.23.02625,"{'Marcin Dzienis': ['Honoraria: MSD, Novartis', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: MSD, BMS, Novartis', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: MSD'], 'Juan Cundom': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca', ""Speakers' Bureau: Takeda""], 'Anna Spreafico': ['Honoraria: Immunocore', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Medison, Immunocore', 'Research Funding: Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Merck (Inst), Symphogen (Inst), AstraZeneca/MedImmune (Inst), Bayer (Inst), Surface Oncology (Inst), Janssen Oncology (Inst), Replimune (Inst), Roche (Inst), Alkermes (Inst), Array BioPharma (Inst), GlaxoSmithKline (Inst), Treadwell Therapeutics (Inst), Amgen (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), ALX Oncology (Inst), Nubiyota (Inst), Genentech (Inst), Seagen (Inst), SERVIER (Inst), Incyte (Inst), Alentis Therapeutics (Inst), Gilead Sciences (Inst)'], 'Andrea S.

Patients and Methods: This was a multi-institutional phase II trial of neoadjuvant osimertinib for patients with surgically resectable stage I-IIIA (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] V7) EGFR-mutated (L858R or exon 19 deletion) NSCLC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03433469). Patients received osimertinib 80 mg orally once daily for up to two 28-day cycles before surgical resection. The primary end point was major pathological response (MPR) rate. Secondary safety and efficacy end points were also assessed. Exploratory end points included pretreatment and post-treatment tumor mutation profiling.

Results: A total of 27 patients were enrolled and treated with neoadjuvant osimertinib for a median 56 days before surgical resection. Twenty-four (89%) patients underwent subsequent surgery; three (11%) patients were converted to definitive chemoradiotherapy. The MPR rate was 14.8% (95% CI, 4.2 to 33.7). No pathological complete responses were observed. The ORR was 52%, and the median DFS was 40.9 months. One treatment-related serious adverse event (AE) occurred (3.7%). No patients were unable to undergo surgical resection or had surgery delayed because of an AE. The most common co-occurring tumor genomic alterations were in TP53 (42%) and RBM10 (21%).

Conclusion: Treatment with neoadjuvant osimertinib in surgically resectable (stage IA-IIIA, AJCC V7) EGFR-mutated NSCLC did not meet its primary end point for MPR rate.

We report the final data analysis of the safety, overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of the phase I patients and seven expansion cohorts.

Methods: This is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, phase I trial. CaboNivo doublet expansion cohorts included (1) mUC, (2) mRCC, and (3) adenocarcinoma of the bladder/urachal; CaboNivoIpi triplet expansion cohorts included (1) mUC, (2) mRCC, (3) penile cancer, and (4) squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder and other rare GU tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02496208).

Results: The study enrolled 120 patients treated with CaboNivo (n = 64) or CaboNivoIpi (n = 56), with a median follow-up of 49.2 months. In 108 evaluable patients (CaboNivo n = 59; CaboNivoIpi n = 49), the ORR was 38% (complete response rate 11%) and the median duration of response was 20 months. The ORR was 42.4% for mUC, 62.5% for mRCC (n = 16), 85.7% for squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder (n = 7), 44.4% for penile cancer (n = 9), and 50.0% for renal medullary carcinoma (n = 2). Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 84% of CaboNivo patients and 80% of CaboNivoIpi patients.

Conclusion: CaboNivo and CaboNivoIpi demonstrated clinical activity and safety in patients with multiple GU malignancies, especially clear cell RCC, urothelial carcinoma, and rare GU tumors such as squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, small cell carcinoma of the bladder, adenocarcinoma of the bladder, renal medullary carcinoma, and penile cancer.",9/1/2024,JCO.23.02233,{}

Ludwig,NY; CA; TX; OH; OR; DC; CO; CA; TX; NC; OH; CA; DC; TX,"Purpose: Ewing Sarcoma (ES), a rare cancer with a pathognomonic translocation resulting in the Ewing sarcoma gene (EWS)::FLI1 oncoprotein, has a poor prognosis in the relapsed/refractory (R/R) setting. Tokalas (TK)216 was designed to bind EWS::FLI1 proteins directly, disrupt protein-protein interactions, and inhibit transcription factor function. TK216 plus vincristine showed synergistic activity in preclinical tumor models. To our knowledge, we report the results of a first-in-class, first-in-human phase I/II trial of TK216 in R/R ES.

Patients and Methods: TK216 was administered intravenously as a continuous infusion to patients with R/R ES in 11 cohorts. The dosing duration of 7 days was later extended to 10, 14, and 28 days. Vincristine could be added on day 1 after cycle 2, per investigators’ choice. The trial used a 3 + 3 design with an expansion cohort at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).

Results: A total of 85 patients with a median age of 27 years (range, 11-77) were enrolled. The maximum tolerated dose for the 14-day infusion of TK216, 200 mg/m2 once daily, was determined in cohort 9 and selected as the RP2D. The median previous number of systemic therapies regimens was three (range, 1-10). The most frequent-related adverse events in patients treated at the RP2D included neutropenia (44.7%), anemia (29.4%), leukopenia (29.4%), febrile neutropenia (15.3%), thrombocytopenia (11.8%), and infections (17.6%). In cohorts 9 and 10, two patients had a complete response, one had a partial response, and 14 had stable disease; the 6-month progression-free survival was 11.9%. There were no responses among the eight patients in cohort 11.

Conclusion: TK216 administered as 14-day continuous infusion with or without vincristine was well tolerated and showed limited activity at the RP2D in R/R ES.",11/1/2024,JCO.24.00020,"{'Paul A.

Patients and Methods: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase II trial using a pick-the-winner design. Eligible patients with clinical T3-4 and/or N+ rectal adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to group A for short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) followed by six cycles of consolidation immunochemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin and toripalimab or to group B for two cycles of induction immunochemotherapy followed by SCRT and the rest four doses. Either total mesorectal excision or WW was applied on the basis of tumor response. The primary end point was CR which included pathological CR (pCR) after surgery and clinical CR (cCR) if WW was applicable, with hypothesis of an increased CR of 40% after iTNT compared with historical data of 25% after conventional TNT.

Results: Of the 130 patients enrolled, 121 pMMR/MSS patients were evaluable (62 in group A and 59 in group B). At a median follow-up of 19 months, CR was achieved at 56.5% in group A and 54.2% in group B. Both groups fulfilled the predefined statistical hypothesis (P < .001). Both groups reported a pCR rate of 50%. Respectively, 15 patients in each group underwent WW and remained disease free. The most frequent grade 3 to 4 toxicities were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Patients in group A had higher rate of cCR (43.5% v 35.6%) at restaging and lower rate of grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia (24.2% v 33.9%) during neoadjuvant treatment.

Conclusion: The iTNT regimens remarkably improved CR rates in pMMR/MSS LARC compared with historical benchmark with acceptable toxicity. Up-front SCRT followed by immunochemotherapy was selected for future definitive study.",10/1/2024,JCO.23.02261,{}

Recently, we reported that dendritic cell (DC)–based immunotherapy induced T-cell responses against pancreatic cancer antigens. The primary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of DC-based immunotherapy to prevent recurrence of disease.

Methods: This was a single-center, open-label, single-arm, combined phase I/II trial. The primary end point was the 2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate. A 2-year RFS rate of ≥60% was defined as a clinically meaningful improvement. We included patients with pancreatic cancer after resection and completion of standard-of-care (SOC) treatment without recurrent disease on cross-sectional imaging. Patients were treated with autologous DCs pulsed with an allogeneic mesothelioma tumor cell lysate, comprising antigens also expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Results: Thirty-eight patients were included in the analysis of the primary end point (47% male, 53% female). The median age was 62 years (IQR, 55-68). Twenty-eight patients (74%) received five DC vaccinations and completed the study protocol. Three patients (8%) received four vaccinations, and seven patients (16%) received three vaccinations. After a median follow-up of 25.5 months, 26 patients (68%) had not developed recurrence of disease. The estimated 2-year RFS was 64%. Vaccination led to the enrichment of circulating activated CD4+ T cells and the detection of treatment-induced immune responses in vitro. T-cell receptor-sequencing analyses of a resected solitary lung metastasis showed influx of vaccine-specific T cells.

Conclusion: This study reached its primary end point of a 2-year RFS rate of ≥60% following pancreatectomy after SOC treatment and adjuvant DC-based immunotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.

Methods: In the ATEMPT phase II trial, patients with stage I centrally confirmed HER2-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned 3:1 to adjuvant T-DM1 for 1 year or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (TH). Coprimary objectives were to compare the incidence of clinically relevant toxicities between arms and to evaluate invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) with T-DM1. Correlative analyses included the HER2DX genomic tool, multiomic evaluations of HER2 heterogeneity, and predictors of thrombocytopenia.

Results: After a median follow-up of 5.8 years, 11 iDFS events were observed in the T-DM1 arm, consistent with a 5-year iDFS of 97.0% (95% CI, 95.2 to 98.7). At 5 years, the recurrence-free interval (RFI) was 98.3% (95% CI, 97.0 to 99.7), the overall survival was 97.8% (95% CI, 96.3 to 99.3), and the breast cancer-specific survival was 99.4% (95% CI, 98.6 to 100). Comparable iDFS was observed with T-DM1 irrespective of tumor size, hormone receptor status, centrally determined HER2 immunohistochemical score, and receipt of T-DM1 for more or less than 6 months. Although ATEMPT was not powered for this end point, the 5-year iDFS in the TH arm was 91.1%. Among patients with sufficient tissue for HER2DX testing (n = 187), 5-year outcomes significantly differed according to HER2DX risk score, with better RFI (98.1% v 81.8%, hazard ratio [HR], 0.10, P = .01) and iDFS (96.3% v 81.8%, HR, 0.20, P = .047) among patients with HER2DX low-risk versus high-risk tumors, respectively.

Conclusion: Adjuvant T-DM1 for 1 year leads to outstanding long-term outcomes for patients with stage I HER2-positive breast cancer. A high HER2DX risk score predicted a higher risk of recurrence in ATEMPT.",11/1/2024,JCO.23.02170,{}

We report results from a first-in-human phase-I study of fianlimab and cemiplimab safety and efficacy in various malignancies including advanced melanoma.

Methods: Patients with advanced melanoma were eligible for enrollment into four cohorts: three for patients without and one for patients with previous anti–PD-1 therapy in the advanced disease setting. Patients were treated with fianlimab 1,600 mg and cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for up to 51 weeks, with an optional additional 51 weeks if clinically indicated. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Results: ORRs were 63% for patients with anti–PD-1–naïve melanoma (cohort-6; n = 40; median follow-up 20.8 months), 63% for patients with systemic treatment–naïve melanoma (cohort-15; n = 40; 11.5 months), and 56% for patients with previous neo/adjuvant treatment melanoma (cohort-16; n = 18, 9.7 months). At a median follow-up of 12.6 months for the combined cohorts (6 + 15 + 16), the ORR was 61.2% and the median progression-free survival (mPFS) 13.3 months (95% CI, 7.5 to not estimated [NE]). In patients (n = 13) with previous anti–PD-1 adjuvant therapy, ORR was 61.5% and mPFS 12 months (95% CI, 1.4 to NE). ORR in patients with previous anti–PD-1 therapy for advanced disease (n = 15) was 13.3% and mPFS 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.3 to 7.7). Treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events ≥grade 3 (G3) were observed in 44% and 22% of patients, respectively. Except for increased incidence of adrenal insufficiency (12%-G1-4, 4%-G3-4), no new safety signals were recorded.

Conclusion: The current results show a promising benefit-risk profile of fianlimab/cemiplimab combination for patients with advanced melanoma, including those with previous anti–PD-1 therapy in the adjuvant, but not advanced, setting.",8/20/2024,JCO.23.02172,"{'Omid Hamid': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Bactonix', 'Honoraria: Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, Pfizer, Regeneron, Immunocore', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Amgen, Novartis, Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, BeiGene, Genentech, GlaxoSmithKline, Immunocore, Incyte, Janssen, Regeneron, Sanofi, Seagen, Tempus, Zelluna, BioAtla, Idera, Pfizer, Iovance Biotherapeutics, Alkermes, Eisai, Bactonix, Georgiamune, GigaGen, Grit Biotechnology, Instil Bio, IO Biotech, KSQ Therapeutics, Moderna Therapeutics, Obsidian Therapeutics, Vial, NGM Biopharmaceuticals', ""Speakers' Bureau: Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis, Pfizer, Regeneron, Immunocore"", 'Research Funding: Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Genentech (Inst), Immunocore (Inst), Incyte (Inst), Merck (Inst), Merck Serono (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Roche (Inst), Amgen (Inst), CytomX Therapeutics (Inst), Iovance Biotherapeutics (Inst), NextCure (Inst), GlaxoSmithKline (Inst), Arcus Biosciences (Inst), Aduro Biotech (Inst), Akeso Biopharma (Inst), Exelixis (Inst), Moderna Therapeutics (Inst), Regeneron (Inst), Sanofi (Inst), Seagen (Inst), Torque (Inst), Zelluna (Inst), Bioatla (Inst), Idera (Inst)'], 'Karl D.

We assessed the safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, and pharmacokinetics of SHR-A1811 in heavily pretreated HER2-expressing or mutated advanced solid tumors.

Methods: This global, multi-center, first-in-human, phase I trial was conducted at 33 centers. Patients who had HER2-expressing or mutated unresectable, advanced, or metastatic solid tumors and were refractory or intolerant to standard therapies were enrolled. SHR-A1811 was administered intravenously at doses ranging from 1.0 to 8.0 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. The primary end points were dose-limiting toxicity, safety, and the recommended phase II dose.

Results: From September 7, 2020, to February 27, 2023, 307 patients who had undergone a median of three (IQR, 2-5) previous treatment regimens in the metastatic setting received SHR-A1811 treatment. As of data cutoff (February 28, 2023), one patient from the 6.4 mg/kg group experienced dose-limiting toxicities (pancytopenia and colitis). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) included decreased neutrophil count (119 [38.8%]) and decreased WBC count (70 [22.8%]). Interstitial lung disease occurred in only eight (2.6%) patients. Serious AEs and deaths occurred in 70 (22.8%) and 13 (4.2%) patients, respectively. SHR-A1811 led to objective responses in 59.9% (184/307) of all patients, 76.3% (90/118) of HER2-positive breast cancer, 60.4% (55/91) of HER2 low-expressing breast cancer, and 45.9% (39/85 with evaluable tumor responses) of the 98 nonbreast tumors.

Conclusion: SHR-A1811 exhibited acceptable tolerability, promising antitumor activity, and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in heavily pretreated advanced solid tumors. The recommended phase II dose of 4.8 or 6.4 mg/kg was selected for various tumor types.",10/10/2024,JCO.23.02044,{}

Materials and Methods: In AMEERA-5 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04478266), a double-blind, double-dummy, international phase III trial, adult pre-/post-menopausal women and men without previous systemic therapy for ER+/HER2– aBC were randomly assigned 1:1 to amcenestrant 200 mg once daily + standard palbociclib dosage (125 mg once daily, 21 days on/7 days off) or letrozole 2.5 mg once daily + standard palbociclib dosage, stratified by de novo metastatic disease, postmenopausal women, and visceral metastasis. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), compared using a stratified log-rank test with one-sided type I error rate of 2.5%. Secondary end points included overall survival (key secondary), pharmacokinetics, and safety.

Results: Between October 14, 2020, and December 2, 2021, 1,068 patients were randomly assigned to amcenestrant + palbociclib (N = 534) or letrozole + palbociclib (N = 534). At the interim analysis (median follow-up 8.4 months), the stratified hazard ratio for PFS was 1.209 (95% CI, 0.939 to 1.557; one-sided P value = .9304); therefore, the study was stopped for futility. The 6-month PFS rate was 82.7% (95% CI, 79.0 to 85.8) with amcenestrant + palbociclib versus 86.9% (95% CI, 83.5 to 89.6) with letrozole + palbociclib. In the amcenestrant + palbociclib versus letrozole + palbociclib groups, treatment-emergent adverse events (any grade) occurred in 85.6% versus 85.4% of patients and grade ≥3 events in 46.3% versus 60.8%, respectively.

Conclusion: The AMEERA-5 study was discontinued on the basis of the recommendation of the data monitoring committee at the interim futility analysis.

Methods: Phase II eligible patients had RRMM that either progressed on/after ≥three lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI), an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), and an anti-CD38 antibody or was triple-class (PI/IMiD/anti-CD38) refractory. Phase II treatment was once a week through week 14 and then once every 2 weeks. Phase II 200 mg patients who achieved a ≥very good partial response by week 24 received linvoseltamab once every 4 weeks. The primary end point in phase II was overall response rate (ORR).

Results: Among the 117 patients treated with 200 mg, the median age was 70 years, 39% had high-risk cytogenetics, and 28% had penta-refractory disease. At a median follow-up of 14.3 months, the ORR was 71%, with 50% achieving ≥complete response (CR). In 104 patients treated with 50 mg at a median follow-up of 7.4 months, the ORR was 48%, with 21% achieving ≥CR. The median duration of response (DOR) for 200 mg patients (n = 83) was 29.4 months (95% CI, 19.2 to not evaluable). Among 200 mg patients, the most common adverse events included cytokine release syndrome (35.0% Gr1, 10.3% Gr2, 0.9% Gr3), neutropenia (0.9% Gr2, 18.8% Gr3, 23.1% Gr4), and anemia (3.4% Gr1, 4.3% Gr2, 30.8% Gr3). Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 7.7% of patients (2.6% each Gr1, Gr2, Gr3). Infections were reported in 74.4% of patients (33.3% Gr3, 2.6% Gr4); infection frequency and severity declined over time.

Conclusion: Linvoseltamab 200 mg induced deep and durable responses, with a median DOR of 29.4 months, in patients with RRMM with an acceptable safety profile.",8/1/2024,JCO.24.01008,"{'Naresh Bumma': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen, Sanofi', ""Speakers' Bureau: Sanofi""], 'Joshua Richter': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Takeda, Adaptive Biotechnologies, Karyopharm Therapeutics, Antengene, Sanofi, Genentech, Pfizer, Janssen, AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene, Regeneron', ""Speakers' Bureau: Celgene, Janssen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi, Adaptive Biotechnologies"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Regeneron'], 'Sundar Jagannath': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb, Janssen, Karyopharm Therapeutics, Legend Biotech, Takeda, Sanofi, Regeneron, Caribou Biosciences', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bristol Myers Squibb, Janssen Biotech, Regeneron'], 'Hans C.

A subcutaneous formulation could improve tolerability and reduce administration time while maintaining efficacy.

Patients and Methods: Patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC who progressed after osimertinib and platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive subcutaneous or intravenous amivantamab, both combined with lazertinib. Coprimary pharmacokinetic noninferiority end points were trough concentrations (Ctrough; on cycle-2-day-1 or cycle-4-day-1) and cycle-2 area under the curve (AUCD1-D15). Key secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Overall survival (OS) was a predefined exploratory end point.

Results: Overall, 418 patients underwent random assignment (subcutaneous group, n = 206; intravenous group, n = 212). Geometric mean ratios of Ctrough for subcutaneous to intravenous amivantamab were 1.15 (90% CI, 1.04 to 1.26) at cycle-2-day-1 and 1.42 (90% CI, 1.27 to 1.61) at cycle-4-day-1; the cycle-2 AUCD1-D15 was 1.03 (90% CI, 0.98 to 1.09). ORR was 30% in the subcutaneous and 33% in the intravenous group; median PFS was 6.1 and 4.3 months, respectively. OS was significantly longer in the subcutaneous versus intravenous group (hazard ratio for death, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.92; nominal P = .02). Fewer patients in the subcutaneous group experienced infusion-related reactions (IRRs; 13% v 66%) and venous thromboembolism (9% v 14%) versus the intravenous group. Median administration time for the first infusion was reduced to 4.8 minutes (range, 0-18) for subcutaneous amivantamab and to 5 hours (range, 0.2-9.9) for intravenous amivantamab. During cycle-1-day-1, 85% and 52% of patients in the subcutaneous and intravenous groups, respectively, considered treatment convenient; the end-of-treatment rates were 85% and 35%, respectively.

Conclusion: Subcutaneous amivantamab-lazertinib demonstrated noninferiority to intravenous amivantamab-lazertinib, offering a consistent safety profile with reduced IRRs, increased convenience, and prolonged survival.",10/20/2024,JCO.24.01001,"{'Natasha B.

Primary analysis is reported.

Methods: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 (stratified by histology, best response to last anti–PD-(L)1–containing regimen, and AGA treatment received or not) to SG (one 10 mg/kg intravenous infusion on days 1 and 8) or docetaxel (one 75 mg/m2 intravenous infusion on day 1) in 21-day cycles. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Key secondary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate, patient-reported symptom assessment, and safety.

Results: In the intention-to-treat population (SG, n = 299; docetaxel, n = 304), 55.4% had one previous line of therapy. Median follow-up was 12.7 months (range, 6.0-24.0). The primary end point was not met. There was a numerical OS improvement for SG versus docetaxel (median, 11.1 v 9.8 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.04]; one-sided P = .0534), consistent across squamous and nonsquamous histologies. Median PFS was 4.1 versus 3.9 months (HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.11]). An OS benefit was observed for SG (n = 192) versus docetaxel (n = 191) in mNSCLC nonresponsive to last anti–PD-(L)1–containing regimen (3.5-month median OS increase; HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.97]); this was consistent across histologies. Among patients receiving SG and docetaxel, 6.8% and 14.2% discontinued because of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), respectively; 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively, had TRAEs leading to death.

Conclusion: Although statistical significance was not met, OS numerically improved with SG versus docetaxel, which was consistent across histologies. Clinically meaningful improvement in OS was noted in mNSCLC nonresponsive to last anti–PD-(L)1–containing regimen.

The phase II LUMINOSITY trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03539536) aimed to identify the optimal c-Met protein–overexpressing non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) population for treatment with Teliso-V (stage I) and expand the selected group for efficacy evaluation (stage II). Stage II enrolled patients with nonsquamous epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-wildtype NSCLC.

Methods: Eligible patients had locally advanced/metastatic c-Met protein–overexpressing NSCLC and ≤2 previous lines of therapy (including ≤1 line of systemic chemotherapy). c-Met protein overexpression in nonsquamous EGFR-wildtype NSCLC was defined as ≥25% tumor cells with 3+ staining (high [≥50% 3+]; intermediate [≥25%–<50%]). Teliso-V was administered at 1.9 mg/kg once every 2 weeks. The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) by independent central review.

Results: In total, 172 patients with nonsquamous EGFR-wildtype NSCLC received Teliso-V in stages I and II. ORR was 28.6% (95% CI, 21.7 to 36.2; c-Met high, 34.6% [95% CI, 24.2 to 46.2]; c-Met intermediate, 22.9% [95% CI, 14.4 to 33.4]). The median duration of response was 8.3 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 11.3; c-Met high, 9.0 [95% CI, 4.2 to 13.0]; c-Met intermediate: 7.2 [95% CI, 5.3 to 11.5]). The median overall survival was 14.5 months (95% CI, 9.9 to 16.6; c-Met high, 14.6 [95% CI, 9.2 to 25.6]; c-Met intermediate, 14.2 [95% CI, 9.6 to 16.6]). The median progression-free survival was 5.7 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 6.9; c-Met high, 5.5 [95% CI, 4.1 to 8.3]; c-Met intermediate: 6.0 [95% CI, 4.5 to 8.1]). Most common any-grade treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were peripheral sensory neuropathy (30%), peripheral edema (16%), and fatigue (14%); the most common grade ≥3 AE was peripheral sensory neuropathy (7%).

Conclusion: Teliso-V was associated with durable responses in c-Met protein–overexpressing nonsquamous EGFR-wildtype NSCLC, especially in those with high c-Met.

Scalp Cooling in Preventing Persistent Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Danbee  Kang; Juhee  Cho; Di  Zhao; Jeonghyun  Kim; Nayeon  Kim; Hoyoung  Kim; Sooyeon  Kim; Ji-Yeon  Kim; Yeon Hee  Park; Young Hyuck  Im; Eliseo  Guallar; Jin Seok  Ahn,Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; MD; MD; Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; Republic of Korea; MD; MD; Republic of Korea,"Purpose: Current studies of the efficacy of scalp cooling are limited by short-term duration. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of scalp cooling in reducing persistent chemotherapy-induced alopecia (PCIA) 6 months after chemotherapy.

Methods: We conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial comparing scalp cooling versus control in newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer stages I-III scheduled to receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy with curative intent between December 2020 and August 2021. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to scalp cooling or usual clinical practice. The primary outcome was PCIA 6 months after chemotherapy. Hair thickness and density were measured using Folliscope 5.0. CIA-related distress was assessed using the CIA distress scale (CADS), with a higher score reflecting higher stress.

Results: The proportion of patients with PCIA at 6 months was 13.5% (12/89) in the scalp-cooling group and 52.0% (26/50) in the control group. The average difference in the change in hair thickness from baseline between the scalp-cooling and control groups was 9.0 μm in favor of the intervention group. The average difference in the change in hair density between intervention and control at the end of the study was –3.3 hairs/cm2. At 6 months after chemotherapy, the average difference in the change in CADS score between the intervention and control groups was –3.2 points, reflecting reduced CIA-related stress in the intervention group.

Conclusion: Scalp cooling reduced the incidence of PCIA, primarily by increasing hair thickness compared with control. Scalp cooling is helpful in promoting qualitative hair regrowth.

The NIFE trial examined nanoliposomal irinotecan/fluorouracil/leucovorin (nal-IRI/FU/LV) as alternative first-line therapy in advanced CCA.

Methods: NIFE is a prospective, open-label, randomized, multicenter phase II study that aimed at detecting efficacy comparable with the standard treatment. Patients with advanced CCA were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive nal-IRI/FU/LV (arm A) or G/C (arm B). Stratification parameters were intrahepatic versus extrahepatic CCA, sex, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG; 0/1). Arm A was designed as a Simon's optimal two-stage design and arm B served as a randomized control group. The primary goal was to exclude an inferior progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months of only 40%, while assuming a rate of 60% on G/C population.

Results: Between 2018 and 2020, overall 91 patients were randomly assigned to receive nal-IRI/FU/LV (n = 49) or G/C (n = 42). The NIFE trial formally met its primary end point with a 4-month PFS rate of 51% in patients receiving nal-IRI/FU/LV. The median PFS was 6 months (2.4-9.6) in arm A and 6.9 months (2.5-7.9) in arm B. Median overall survival (OS) was 15.9 months (10.6-20.3) in arm A and 13.6 months (6.5-17.7) in arm B. The exploratory comparison of study arms suggested a numerical but statistically not significant advantage for nal-IRI/FU/LV (hazard ratio for PFS, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.53 to 1.38] and for OS, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.58 to 1.50]). Analysis for stratification parameters revealed no differences for sex and ECOG, but for tumor localization. The objective response rate was 24.5% with nal-IRI/FU/LV and 11.9% with G/C. No unexpected toxicities occurred. AEs related to nal-IRI/FU/LV were mainly GI and to G/C hematologic.

Conclusion: Treatment of advanced CCA with nal-IRI/FU/LV demonstrated efficacy in first-line therapy without new safety findings and merits further validation.",9/10/2024,JCO.23.01566,"{'Thomas J.

Coprimary end points were objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review and overall survival (OS) in patients with International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) intermediate-/poor-risk disease.

Results: Overall, 623 patients were randomly assigned to BEMPEG plus NIVO (n = 311) or TKI (n = 312; sunitinib n = 225, cabozantinib n = 87), of whom 514 (82.5%) had IMDC intermediate-/poor-risk disease. In patients with IMDC intermediate-/poor-risk disease, ORR with BEMPEG plus NIVO versus TKI was 23.0% (95% CI, 18.0 to 28.7) versus 30.6% (95% CI, 25.1 to 36.6; difference, –7.7 [95% CI, –15.2 to –0.2]; P = .0489), and median OS was 29.0 months versus not estimable (hazard ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.10]; P = .192), respectively. More frequent all-grade treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) with BEMPEG plus NIVO versus TKI included pyrexia (32.6% v 2.0%) and pruritus (31.3% v 8.8%). Grade 3/4 TRAEs were less frequent with BEMPEG plus NIVO (25.8%) versus TKI (56.5%).

Conclusion: First-line BEMPEG plus NIVO for advanced/metastatic ccRCC did not improve efficacy in patients with intermediate-/poor-risk disease but led to fewer grade 3/4 TRAEs versus TKI.",8/10/2024,JCO.23.02082,"{'Nizar M.

Patients and Methods: Chemotherapy-naïve patients scheduled to receive carboplatin (AUC ≥5) were randomly assigned to receive either olanzapine 5 mg once daily (olanzapine group) or placebo (placebo group) in combination with aprepitant, a 5-HT3 RA, and dexamethasone. The primary end point was the complete response (CR; no vomiting and no rescue therapy) rate in the overall phase (0-120 hours). Secondary end points included the proportion of patients free of nausea and safety.

Results: In total, 355 patients (78.6% male, median age 72 years, 100% thoracic cancer), including 175 and 180 patients in the olanzapine and placebo groups, respectively, were evaluated. The overall CR rate was 86.9% in the olanzapine group versus 80.6% in the placebo group. The intergroup difference in the overall CR rate was 6.3% (95% CI, –1.3 to 13.9). The proportions of patients free of chemotherapy-induced nausea in the overall (88.6% in the olanzapine group v 75.0% in the placebo group) and delayed (89.7% v 75.6%, respectively) phases were significantly higher in the olanzapine group than in the placebo group (both P < .001). Somnolence was observed in 43 (24.6%) and 41 (22.9%) patients in the olanzapine and placebo groups, respectively, and no events were grade ≥3 in severity.

In the LEAP-017 study, we evaluate whether lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab improves outcomes compared with standard of care (SOC) in previously treated mismatch repair proficient or not microsatellite instability high (pMMR or not MSI-H) mCRC.

Methods: In this international, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, phase III study, eligible patients age 18 years and older with unresectable, pMMR or not MSI-H mCRC, that had progressed on or after, or could not tolerate, standard treatment, were randomly assigned 1:1 to lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily plus pembrolizumab 400 mg intravenously once every 6 weeks or investigator's choice of regorafenib or trifluridine/tipiracil (SOC). Randomization was stratified by presence or absence of liver metastases. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). LEAP-017 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04776148), and has completed recruitment.

Results: Between April 8, 2021, and December 21, 2021, 480 patients were randomly assigned to lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (n = 241) or SOC (n = 239). At final analysis (median follow-up of 18.6 months [IQR, 3.9]), median OS with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus SOC was 9.8 versus 9.3 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.02]; P = .0379; prespecified threshold P = .0214). Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 58.4% (lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab) versus 42.1% (SOC) of patients. Two participants died due to treatment-related adverse events, both in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab arm.

Conclusion: In patients with pMMR or not MSI-H mCRC that had progressed on previous therapy, there was no statistically significant improvement in OS after lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab treatment versus SOC. No new safety signals were observed.",8/20/2024,JCO.23.02736,{}

Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, improved progression-free survival in hormone receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer (BC) when combined with endocrine therapy (ET). In this phase III randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed the efficacy of everolimus + ET as adjuvant therapy in high-risk, hormone receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative BC after adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Methods: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to physician's choice ET and 1 year of everolimus (10 mg orally once daily) or placebo stratified by risk group. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) evaluated by a stratified log-rank test with the hazard ratio (HR) estimated by Cox regression. Subset analyses included preplanned evaluation by risk group and exploratory analyses by menopausal status and age. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and safety. Everolimus did not improve IDFS/OS when added to ET in patients with early-stage high-risk, hormone receptor–positive BC.

Results: One thousand and nine hundred thirty-nine patients were randomly assigned with 1,792 eligible for analysis. Overall, no benefit of everolimus was seen for IDFS (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.14]) or OS (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.26]). The assumption of proportional hazards was not met suggesting significant variability in the HR over time since the start of treatment. In an unplanned subgroup analysis among postmenopausal patients (N = 1,221), no difference in IDFS (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.36]) or OS (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.89 to 1.60]) was seen. In premenopausal patients (N = 571), everolimus improved both IDFS (HR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.94]) and OS (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28 to 0.86]). Treatment completion rates were lower in the everolimus arm compared with placebo (48% v 73%) with higher grade 3 and 4 adverse events (35% v 7%).

This investigation evaluates the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 80 mg once daily osimertinib in patients with LMs resistant to prior first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs.

Materials and Methods: In this phase II multicenter, open-label, single-arm study, 80 mg osimertinib was administered to patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who had developed LMs subsequent to treatment with prior EGFR TKIs. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), assessed alongside objective response rate by the blinded independent central review (BICR) and a pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the first day of cycles 3 and 6.

Results: A total of 73 patients diagnosed with LM were treated with osimertinib, including 64 patients evaluable for the LM efficacy set—T790M negative (n = 62) and T790M positive (n = 2). The median OS in the full-analysis set was 15.6 months (95% CI, 11.5 to 20.2). The objective response rate for LM was 51.6%, including a 15.6% complete response, and the disease control rate was 81.3% by BICR in the LM efficacy evaluable set. The median LM progression-free survival by BICR was 11.2 months (95% CI, 7.7 to 15.3), the duration of response was 12.6 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 17.7), and OS was 15.0 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 18.7). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the CSF to free plasma osimertinib ratio was 22%. Most safety profiles were grade 1 and 2.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates significant intracranial efficacy and survival benefits of 80 mg once daily osimertinib in NSCLC patients with LMs. The data support considering daily 80 mg of osimertinib as a treatment option for EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients with LMs, irrespective of T790M mutation status.",8/10/2024,JCO.24.00708,"{'Richard Baldry': ['Employment: AstraZeneca', 'Stock or Other Ownership: AstraZeneca'], 'Hyun Ae Jung': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Yuhan, Guardant Health, AIMEDBIO', 'Research Funding: Yuhan'], 'Jong-Mu Sun': ['Research Funding: Yuhan (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), pfizer (Inst)'], 'Se-Hoon Lee': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Roche, Lilly, Amgen, Yuhan, Merck Sharp & Dohme', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Roche, Pfizer, Lilly, BMS/Ono, Takeda, Janssen, IMBdx, Abion, BeiGene, Daiichi Sankyo, ImmuneOncia, Merck (German), Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis', ""Speakers' Bureau: Abion"", 'Research Funding: AstraZeneca (Inst), Lunit (Inst), Merck Sharp & Dohme (Inst)'], 'Jin Seok Ahn': ['Honoraria: Pfizer, Roche, BC World Pharmaceutical, Yuhan, Novartis, Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Menarini, Kyowa Kirin, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Lilly, Takeda, Boryung, Samyang, Nokwon Medical', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Pharmbio Korea, Guardant Health, Yuhan, ImmuneOncia, Therapex, Daiichi Sankyo Korea, Roche'], 'Youngjoo Lee': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, MSD, Yuhan'], 'Dong-Wan Kim': ['Research Funding: Alpha Biopharma (Inst), AstraZeneca/MedImmune (Inst), Hanmi (Inst), Janssen (Inst), Merus (Inst), Mirati Therapeutics (Inst), MSD (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Ono Pharmaceutical (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Roche/Genentech (Inst), Takeda (Inst), TP Therapeutics (Inst), Xcovery (Inst), Yuhan (Inst), Boehringer Ingelheim (Inst), Amgen (Inst), Daiichi Sankyo (Inst), Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical (Inst), BridgeBio Pharma (Inst), GlaxoSmithKline (Inst), Merck (Inst), inno.N (Inst), IMBdx (Inst), IMBdx (Inst)'], 'Ki Hyeong Lee': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb, MSD, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Lilly', 'Research Funding: Merck'], 'Myung-Ju Ahn': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Lilly, MSD, Takeda, Amgen, Merck Serono, Yuhan, Daiichi Sankyo/Astra Zeneca', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Lilly, MSD, Takeda, Alpha pharmaceutical, Amgen, Merck Serono, Pfizer, Yuhan, Arcus Ventures, Daiichi Sankyo/Astra Zeneca, Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca', 'Research Funding: Yuhan']}"

Statistically standardized quantitated positivity could indicate differential associations of positivity with breast cancer outcomes.

Methods: MA.27 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00066573) was a phase III adjuvant trial of exemestane versus anastrozole in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. Immunochemistry ER and PgR HSCORE and % positivity (%+) were centrally assessed by machine image quantitation and statistically standardized to mean 0 and standard deviation (SD) 1 after Box-Cox variance stabilization transformations of square for ER; for PgR, (1) natural logarithm (0.1 added to 0 HSCOREs and 0%+) and (2) square root. Our primary end point was MA.27 distant disease-free survival (DDFS) at a median 4.1-year follow-up, and secondary end point was event-free survival (EFS). Univariate survival with cut points at SDs about a mean of 0 (≤–1; (–1, 0]; (0, 1]; >1) was described with Kaplan-Meier plots and examined with Wilcoxon (Peto-Prentice) test statistic. Adjusted Cox multivariable regressions had two-sided Wald tests and nominal significance P < .05.

Results: Of 7,576 women accrued, 3,048 women's tumors had machine-quantitated image analysis results: 2,900 (95%) for ER, 2,726 (89%) for PgR, and 2,582 (85% of 3,048) with both ER and PgR. Higher statistically standardized ER and PgR HSCORE and %+ were associated with better univariate DDFS and EFS (P < .001). In multivariable assessments, ER HSCORE and %+ were not significantly associated (P = .52-.88) with DDFS in models with PgR, whereas higher PgR HSCORE and %+ were significantly associated with better DDFS (P = .001) in models with ER.

Conclusion: Adjunctive statistical standardization differentiated quantitated levels of ER and PgR.

We report outcomes from the pivotal TRUST-I study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04395677) of taletrectinib for ROS1+ non–small cell lung cancer in China.

Methods: TRUST-I evaluated TKI-naїve and crizotinib-pretreated patients. The primary end point was confirmed ORR (cORR) by independent review committee; key secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), PFS, and safety.

Results: As of November 2023, 173 patients were enrolled (median age, 55 years; 58% female; 73% never smoked; TKI naїve: n = 106; crizotinib pretreated: n = 67). In TKI-naїve patients, cORR and intracranial cORR were 91% and 88%, respectively, and 52% and 73% in crizotinib-pretreated patients. In TKI-naїve patients, median DOR and median PFS were not reached (NR) with 22.1-month and 23.5-month follow-up, respectively. In crizotinib-pretreated patients, the median DOR was 10.6 months (95% CI, 6.3 months to NR; 8.4-month follow-up), and the median PFS was 7.6 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 12.0 months; 9.7-month follow-up). Eight of 12 patients (67%) with G2032R mutations responded. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were increased AST (76%), diarrhea (70%), and increased ALT (68%), most of which were grade 1-2. Incidences of neurologic TEAEs were low (dizziness: 23%; dysgeusia: 10%) and mostly grade 1. Discontinuations (5%) and dose reductions (19%) due to TEAEs were low.

Conclusion: Taletrectinib continues to show high and durable overall responses, prolonged PFS, robust activity against intracranial lesions and acquired resistance mutations including G2032R, and a favorable safety profile with a low incidence of neurologic TEAEs.",8/1/2024,JCO.24.00731,"{'Yizhong Ren': ['Employment: AnHeart Therapeutics'], 'Bing Yan': ['Employment: AnHeart Therapeutics Ltd', 'Leadership: AnHeart Therapeutics Ltd', 'Research Funding: AnHeart Therapeutics Ltd', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Taletrectinib was licensed from Daiichi Sankyu (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: AnHeart Therapeutics Ltd'], 'Christine M.

Bauer,Australia; Canada; Spain; China; Singapore; France; MA; Italy; Japan; China; Republic of Korea; CA; Italy; Italy; Italy; Italy; Italy; TN,"Purpose: Lorlatinib improved progression-free survival (PFS) and intracranial activity versus crizotinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced, ALK-positive non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the phase III CROWN study. Here, we report long-term outcomes from CROWN after 5 years of follow-up.

Methods: Two hundred ninety-six patients with ALK-positive NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive lorlatinib 100 mg once daily (n = 149) or crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (n = 147). This post hoc analysis presents updated investigator-assessed efficacy outcomes, safety, and biomarker analyses.

Results: With a median follow-up for PFS of 60.2 and 55.1 months, respectively, median PFS was not reached (NR [95% CI, 64.3 to NR]) with lorlatinib and 9.1 months (95% CI, 7.4 to 10.9) with crizotinib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.19 [95% CI, 0.13 to 0.27]); 5-year PFS was 60% (95% CI, 51 to 68) and 8% (95% CI, 3 to 14), respectively. Median time to intracranial progression was NR (95% CI, NR to NR) with lorlatinib and 16.4 months (95% CI, 12.7 to 21.9) with crizotinib (HR, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.12]). Safety profile was consistent with that in prior analyses. Emerging new ALK resistance mutations were not detected in circulating tumor DNA collected at the end of lorlatinib treatment.

Conclusion: After 5 years of follow-up, median PFS has yet to be reached in the lorlatinib group, corresponding to the longest PFS ever reported with any single-agent molecular targeted treatment in advanced NSCLC and across all metastatic solid tumors. These results coupled with prolonged intracranial efficacy and absence of new safety signals represent an unprecedented outcome for patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and set a new benchmark for targeted therapies in cancer.",10/10/2024,JCO.24.00581,"{'Benjamin J.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), a secondary outcome from HIMALAYA, are reported here.

Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to receive STRIDE, durvalumab, or sorafenib. PROs were assessed (preplanned secondary outcome) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire and the 18-item HCC module. Time to deterioration (TTD), change from baseline and improvement rate in global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL), functioning, and disease-related symptoms were analyzed.

Results: In total, 1,171 participants were randomly assigned to STRIDE (n = 393), durvalumab (n = 389), or sorafenib (n = 389) and were evaluable for PRO assessments. Across treatment arms, compliance rates for PROs were >77% at baseline and >70% overall. Baseline scores were comparable across treatment arms. TTD in GHS/QoL, physical functioning, fatigue, appetite loss, and abdominal pain was numerically longer for both STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. Clinically meaningful deterioration in PROs was not observed in any treatment arm. However, TTD in nausea and abdominal swelling was numerically longer for STRIDE versus sorafenib, and the likelihood of clinically meaningful improvement in GHS/QoL, role, emotional and social functioning, and disease-related symptoms was greater with STRIDE and durvalumab versus sorafenib. PROs with STRIDE and durvalumab were generally similar.

Conclusion: Compared with sorafenib, STRIDE and durvalumab were associated with clinically meaningful, patient-centered GHS/QoL, functioning, and symptom benefits in people with uHCC. These findings support the benefits of the STRIDE regimen compared with sorafenib for a diverse population reflective of the global uHCC population.",8/10/2024,JCO.23.01462,{}

Here, we report the pooled analysis results of two exploratory clinical trials to evaluate CT041 in patients with previously treated pancreatic cancer (PC).

Patients and Methods: These two multicenter, open-label phase I/Ib trials (CT041-CG4006, CT041-ST-01) have a similar target population and evaluation schedule. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of CT041, whereas secondary objectives included efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity.

Results: The combined cohort comprised 24 patients with advanced PC. Among them, five patients (20.8%) had previously received one line of therapy, whereas 19 (79.2%) received ≥2 lines of therapy. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or more were preconditioning-related hematologic toxicities. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and GI disorders were most reported grade 1 or 2 adverse events. The overall response rate and disease control rate were 16.7% and 70.8%. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) after infusion was 3.3 months (95% CI, 1.8 to 6.2), and the median overall survival (mOS) was 10.0 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 17.6). The median duration of response (mDoR)was 9.5 months (95% CI, 2.6 to Not reached), with a DoR rate at 12 months of 50% (95% CI, 5.8 to 84.5). The mPFS (6.0 v 1.0 months, P < .001) and mOS (17.6 v 4.0 months, P < .001) were prolonged in patients achieving partial response/stable disease than the progressive disease group. CA19-9 levels had reduced by at least 30% in 17 (70.8%) patients.

Conclusion: In patients with metastatic PC after progression on previous therapy, CT041 demonstrated a tolerable safety profile and encouraging anticancer efficacy signals. Response benefit observed here needs to be ascertained in the future.",7/20/2024,JCO.23.02314,{}

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a VEGF receptor (VEGFR) vaccine containing VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 peptides in patients with NF2 with progressive schwannomas (jRCTs031180184).

Materials AND Methods: VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 peptides were injected subcutaneously into infra-axillary and inguinal regions, once a week for 4 weeks and then once a month for 4 months. The primary end point was safety. Secondary end points included tolerability, hearing response, imaging response, and immunologic response.

Results: Sixteen patients with NF2 with progressive schwannomas completed treatment and were assessed. No severe vaccine-related adverse events occurred. Among the 13 patients with assessable hearing, word recognition score improved in five patients at 6 months and two at 12 months. Progression of average hearing level of pure tone was 0.168 dB/mo during the year of treatment period, whereas long-term progression was 0.364 dB/mo. Among all 16 patients, a partial response was observed in more than one schwannoma in four (including one in which Bev had not been effective), minor response in 5, and stable disease in 4. Both VEGFR1-specific and VEGFR2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were induced in 11 patients.

We hypothesized that adding the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib to standard chemotherapy would be tolerable and improve progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with ovarian cancer in the upfront setting.

Materials and Methods: Patients with ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal carcinoma recommended for neoadjuvant chemotherapy were eligible. In phase I, treatment was initiated with dose-dense paclitaxel (P) 70 mg/m2 once daily on days 1, 8, and 15; carboplatin AUC 5 intravenously day 1; and ruxolitinib 15 mg orally (PO) twice a day, every 21 days (dose level 1). Interval debulking surgery (IDS) was required after cycle 3. Patients then received three additional cycles of chemotherapy/ruxolitinib, followed by maintenance ruxolitinib. In the randomized phase II, patients were randomly assigned to paclitaxel/carboplatin with or without ruxolitinib at 15 mg PO twice a day for three cycles, IDS, followed by another three cycles of chemotherapy/ruxolitinib, without further maintenance ruxolitinib. The primary phase II end point was PFS.

Results: Seventeen patients were enrolled in phase I. The maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose were established to be dose level 1. One hundred thirty patients were enrolled in phase II with a median follow-up of 24 months. The regimen was well tolerated, with a trend toward higher grade 3 to 4 anemia (64% v 27%), grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (53% v 37%), and thromboembolic events (12.6% v 2.4%) in the experimental arm. In the randomized phase II, the median PFS in the reference arm was 11.6 versus 14.6 in the experimental, hazard ratio (HR) for PFS was 0.702 (log-rank P = .059). The overall survival HR was 0.785 (P = .24).

Conclusion: Ruxolitinib 15 mg PO twice a day was well tolerated with acceptable toxicity in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy. The primary end point of prolongation of PFS was achieved in the experimental arm, warranting further investigation.",7/20/2024,JCO.23.02076,{}

Methods: In this open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II trial, pre/perimenopausal women with clinically aggressive HR+/HER2– ABC were randomly assigned 1:1 to first-line ribociclib (600 mg once daily; 3 weeks on, 1 week off) plus letrozole/anastrozole and goserelin or investigator's choice of combination CT (docetaxel plus capecitabine, paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, or capecitabine plus vinorelbine). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).

Results: Among 222 patients randomly assigned to ribociclib plus ET (n = 112) or combination CT (n = 110), 150 (67.6%) had symptomatic visceral metastases, 41 (18.5%) had rapid disease progression per investigator's judgment, and 31 (14.0%) had symptomatic nonvisceral disease. Overall, 106 (47.7%) patients had investigator-assessed visceral crisis. The median follow-up time was 37.0 months. At data cutoff, 31.3% (ribociclib arm) and 15.5% (CT arm) of patients had completed study treatment and transitioned to post-trial access. The median PFS was 21.8 months (ribociclib plus ET; [95% CI, 17.4 to 26.7]) and 12.8 months (combination CT; [95% CI, 10.1 to 18.4); hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.87]; P = .003. The overall response rates and the median time to response in the ribociclib versus CT arms, respectively, were 66.1% and 61.8% and 4.9 months and 3.2 months (hazard ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.06]). Lower rates of symptomatic adverse events were observed in the ribociclib versus CT arm.

Conclusion: First-line ribociclib plus ET showed a significant PFS benefit, similar response rates, and better tolerability over combination CT in patients with clinically aggressive HR+/HER2– ABC.",8/10/2024,JCO.24.00144,"{'Yen-Shen Lu': ['Honoraria: Pfizer, Roche, MSD, Novartis, Lilly, Eisai, Daiichi Sankyo/UCB Japan, AstraZeneca, EuroPharma', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Pfizer, Roche, Novartis, Lilly', 'Research Funding: Novartis (Inst), MSD (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Novartis'], 'Hamdy Azim': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Lilly, MSD, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi/Aventis', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Lilly, MSD, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi/Aventis', ""Speakers' Bureau: AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Lilly, MSD, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche"", 'Research Funding: Roche, Novartis'], 'Yesim Eralp': ['Honoraria: Gilead Sciences, Amgen, BMS Turkey, Amgen, AstraZeneca', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, MSD Oncology, Gilead Sciences, MSD Oncology, Lilly, Novartis, MSD Oncology, MSD Oncology, GlaxoSmithKline, MSD Oncology, Novartis', 'Research Funding: Novartis', 'Other Relationship: Novartis'], 'Yoon Sim Yap': ['Honoraria: Novartis, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, MSD, Gilead Sciences, DKSH', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, Lilly, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, MSD', 'Research Funding: MSD Oncology (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: DKSH, AstraZeneca, MSD, Pfizer, Daiichi Sankyo'], 'Seock-Ah Im': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Novartis, Roche/Genentech, Eisai, Pfizer, Amgen, Hanmi, Lilly, MSD, Daiichi Sankyo', 'Research Funding: AstraZeneca (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Roche/Genentech (Inst), Daewoong Pharmaceutical (Inst), Eisai (Inst), Boryung Pharmaceuticals (Inst)', 'Other Relationship: Roche'], 'Erhan Gokmen': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Immunogen, MacroGenics, G1 Therapeutics, Fibrogen', 'Honoraria: Lilly, Roche, Pfizer, Novartis, Janssen Oncology, Astellas Pharma, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene, Gilead Sciences, Sandoz-Novartis, Abdi Ibrahim, MSD Oncology, Genekor, Abbvie', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Novartis, Pfizer, Lilly, MSD Oncology, Gilead Sciences, AstraZeneca', ""Speakers' Bureau: Pfizer, Roche, Novartis, Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene, Genekor, AstraZeneca"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer, Roche, MSD Oncology, Novartis, BMS'], 'Ahmed El Bastawisy': ['Honoraria: Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca, MSD Oncology, Eva Pharma (Inst), Amgen', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: MSD Oncology, Novartis, Pfizer', ""Speakers' Bureau: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Amgen, Novartis, MSD Oncology, Eva Pharma"", 'Research Funding: Roche, Novartis, AstraZeneca, MSD Oncology', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer, Eva Pharma, Pierre Fabre, MSD Oncology'], 'Yueh Ni Lim': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Pfizer', ""Speakers' Bureau: Novartis, Eisai, Roche"", 'Research Funding: Arcus Biosciences, Yuhan, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, MSD Oncology', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche, Roche, Amgen, MSD Oncology, AstraZeneca, Ipsen, Novartis, Arcus Biosciences, Varian Medical Systems, MSD Oncology, Roche, Astellas Pharma'], 'Wei-Pang Chung': ['Honoraria: Amgen, AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca, Lilly, Gilead Sciences, MSD Oncology, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Viatris', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca, Lilly, Gilead Sciences, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca'], 'Konstantin Penkov': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Nektar', 'Research Funding: AstraZeneca/MedImmune (Inst), MSD (Inst), Nektar (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Regeneron (Inst), Roche (Inst)'], 'James Bowles': ['Employment: Novartis', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: AstraZeneca, Novartis, BeiGene, Pfizer, BioNTech SE', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Novartis'], 'Teresa Delgar Alfaro': ['Employment: Novartis'], 'Jiwen Wu': ['Employment: Novartis, Geron', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Novartis, Geron'], 'Melissa Gao': ['Employment: Novartis', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Novartis'], 'Khemaies Slimane': ['Employment: Novartis', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Novartis', 'Honoraria: Novartis', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Novartis'], 'Nagi S.

To enhance T cell activity against GD2+ CNS malignancies, we modified GD2-directed CART cells (GD2.CARTs) with a constitutively active interleukin (IL)-7 receptor (C7R-GD2.CARTs).

Methods: Patients age 1-21 years with H3K27-altered diffuse midline glioma (DMG) or other recurrent GD2-expressing CNS tumors were eligible for this phase I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04099797). All subjects received standard-of-care adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy before study enrollment. The first treatment cohort received GD2.CARTs alone (1 × 107 cells/m2), and subsequent cohorts received C7R-GD2.CARTs at two dose levels (1 × 107 cells/m2; 3 × 107 cells/m2). Standard lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine was included at all dose levels.

Results: Eleven patients (age 4-18 years) received therapy without dose-limiting toxicity. The GD2.CART cohort did not experience toxicity, but had disease progression after brief improvement of residual neurologic deficits (≤3 weeks). The C7R-GD2.CART cohort developed grade 1 tumor inflammation–associated neurotoxicity in seven of eight (88%) cases, controllable with anakinra. Cytokine release syndrome was observed in six of eight (75%, grade 1 in all but one patient) and associated with increased circulating IL-6 and IP-10 (P < .05). Patients receiving C7R-GD2.CARTs experienced temporary improvement from baseline neurologic deficits (range, 2 to >12 months), and seven of eight (88%) remained eligible for additional treatment cycles (range 2-4 cycles). Partial responses by iRANO criteria were observed in two of seven (29%) patients with DMG treated by C7R-GD2.CARTs.

Conclusion: Intravenous GD2.CARTs with and without C7R were well tolerated. Patients treated with C7R-GD2.CARTs exhibited transient improvement of neurologic deficits and increased circulating cytokines/chemokines. Treatment with C7R-GD2.CARTs represents a novel approach warranting further investigation for children with these incurable CNS cancers.",8/10/2024,JCO.23.02019,"{'Natalia Lapteva': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Tessa Therapeutics', 'Research Funding: Tessa Therapeutics', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Received royalties from licensed technology patent with Baylor College of Medicine'], 'Sachin Thakkar': ['Honoraria: Guidepoint Global', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Dexter', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Dry Adjuvanted Immune Stimulating Compositions and Use Thereof for Mucosal Administration'], 'Thomas Shum': ['Employment: Mass General Brigham', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Shum Technologies, Inc', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Thomas Shum has received patent licensing payments from Gracell Biotechnologies Inc', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: RadPartners'], 'Holly B.

"Methylphenidate Versus Placebo for Treating Fatigue in Patients With Advanced Cancer: Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter, Placebo-Controlled Trial",Patrick Charles  Stone; Ollie  Minton; Alison  Richardson; Peter  Buckle; Zinat E.  Enayat; Louise  Marston; Nick  Freemantle,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,"Purpose: To compare effects and side effects of 6 weeks of individually dose-titrated methylphenidate or placebo on fatigue in palliative care patients with advanced cancer.

Methods: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Eligible patients had advanced incurable cancer and fatigue >3/10. Principal exclusions were hypertension; psychiatric, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, renal, liver, or blood disorders; substance dependency; and epilepsy. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 methylphenidate or placebo starting at 5 mg twice daily. Dose of methylphenidate/placebo was titrated once per week, over 6 weeks, up to a maximum of 20 mg three times daily. Trial ended at 10 weeks. Primary outcome was the difference in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) scores between groups at 6 ± 2 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects, quality of life, and mood.

Results: One hundred sixty-two patients (73 men; mean, 65.8; standard deviation [SD], 10.3 years) were randomly assigned, and three were excluded from analysis. Seventy-seven were allocated placebo (baseline FACIT-F = 22 [SD, 10]); 82 were allocated methylphenidate (FACIT-F = 20 [SD, 9]). After 6 ± 2 weeks, FACIT-F scores were 1.97 points (95% CI, –0.95 to 4.90; P = .186) higher (better) on methylphenidate than placebo. Across 10 weeks of the study, FACIT-F was nominally higher in the methylphenidate group versus placebo (Diff, 2.20 [95% CI, 0.39 to 4.01]), but this did not reach the minimally clinically important difference (5-points). At 6 weeks, there were no differences between groups in quality-of-life or symptom domains except for depression scores (nominally reduced in the methylphenidate group: Diff, –1.35 [95% CI, –2.41 to –0.30]). There were no differences in mortality or serious adverse events.

Conclusion: After 6 ± 2 weeks of treatment, methylphenidate was not superior to placebo for treating fatigue in advanced cancer. Methylphenidate was safe and well-tolerated.",7/10/2024,JCO.23.02639,{}

Results of a cohort of patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) with ERBB2/3 amplification, overexpression, or mutation treated with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab are reported.

Methods: Eligible patients had advanced BTC, measurable disease (RECIST v1.1), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, adequate organ function, tumors with ERBB2/3 alterations, and a lack of standard treatment options. Simon's two-stage design was used with a primary end point of disease control (DC), defined as objective response (OR) or stable disease of at least 16+ weeks duration (SD16+) according to RECIST v1.1. Secondary end points included OR, progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, duration of stable disease, and safety.

Results: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled from February 2017 to January 2022, and all had advanced BTC with an ERBB2/3 alteration. One patient was not evaluable for efficacy. One complete response, eight partial responses, and two SD16+ were observed for DC and OR rates of 40% (90% CI, 27 to 100) and 32% (95% CI, 16 to 52), respectively. The null hypothesis of 15% DC rate was rejected (P = .0015). Four patients had at least one grade 3 adverse event (AE) or serious AE at least possibly related to treatment: anemia, diarrhea, infusion-related reaction, and fatigue.

Methods: Patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic GC/GEJC were randomly assigned 1:1 to nivolumab + relatlimab (fixed-dose combination) + chemotherapy or nivolumab + chemotherapy. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR; per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review [BICR]) in patients whose tumors had LAG-3 expression ≥1%.

Results: Of 274 patients, 138 were randomly assigned to nivolumab + relatlimab + chemotherapy and 136 to nivolumab + chemotherapy. Median follow-up was 11.9 months. In patients with LAG-3 expression ≥1%, BICR-assessed ORR (95% CI) was 48% (38 to 59) in the nivolumab + relatlimab + chemotherapy arm and 61% (51 to 71) in the nivolumab + chemotherapy arm; median progression-free survival (95% CI) by BICR was 7.0 months (5.8 to 8.4) versus 8.3 months (6.9 to 12.1; hazard ratio [HR], 1.41 [95% CI, 0.97 to 2.05]), and median overall survival (95% CI) was 13.5 months (11.9 to 19.1) versus 16.0 months (10.9 to not estimable; HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.54]), respectively. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 69% and 61% of all treated patients, and 42% and 36% of patients discontinued because of any-grade TRAEs in the nivolumab + relatlimab + chemotherapy and nivolumab + chemotherapy arms, respectively.

Conclusion: RELATIVITY-060 did not meet its primary end point of improved ORR in patients with LAG-3 expression ≥1% when relatlimab was added to nivolumab + chemotherapy compared with nivolumab + chemotherapy.

Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive two cycles of capecitabine, XELOX, or PF along with concurrent intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Patients in each arm were again randomly assigned to receive two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy or not. The primary end points were 2-year overall survival (OS) rate and incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs).

Results: A total of 246 patients were randomly assigned into the capecitabine (n = 80), XELOX (n = 85), and PF (n = 81) arms. In capecitabine, XELOX, and PF arms, the 2-year OS rate was 75%, 66.7%, and 70.9% (capecitabine v PF: hazard ratio [HR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.61 to 1.35]; nominal P = .637; XELOX v PF: 0.86 [95% CI, 0.58 to 1.27]; P = .444); the median OS was 40.9 (95% CI, 34.4 to 49.9), 41.9 (95% CI, 28.6 to 52.1), and 35.4 (95% CI, 30.4 to 45.4) months. The incidence of grade ≥3 AEs during the entire treatment was 28.8%, 36.5%, and 45.7%, respectively. Comparing the consolidation chemotherapy with the nonconsolidation chemotherapy groups, the median OS was 41.9 (95% CI, 34.6 to 52.8) versus 36.9 (95% CI, 28.5 to 44) months (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.99]; nominal P = .0403).

Conclusion: Capecitabine or XELOX did not significantly improve the 2-year OS rate over PF in DCRT for inoperable locally advanced ESCC.

Lesser,NC; NC; NC; NC; IL; IL; MN; IL; NC; NC; NC; NC,"Purpose: To test efficacy of donepezil, a cognitive enhancer, to improve memory in breast cancer survivors who report cancer-related cognitive impairment 1-5 years postchemotherapy.

Patients and Methods: Adult female BCS exposed to ≥4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy 1-5 years before enrollment who reported cancer-related cognitive impairment were eligible. Participants, enrolled at sites affiliated with the Wake Forest NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base, were randomly assigned to receive 5 mg of donepezil once daily for 6 weeks titrated to 10 mg once daily for 18 weeks or placebo. Cognition and self-report cognitive functioning was assessed at baseline, 12, 24 (end of intervention), and 36 (washout) weeks postrandomization. Mixed-effects repeated measures analysis of covariance models were used to assess treatment differences in immediate recall (primary outcome) on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) and other cognitive domains (secondary outcomes) with covariates of treatment, time, time by treatment interaction, baseline outcome level, age stratification, and an unstructured covariance matrix to account for within participant correlation over time.

Results: Two hundred seventy-six BCS from 87 NCORP practices (mean age, 57.1, standard deviation [SD], 10.5) who were at a mean of 29.6 months (SD, 14.2) postchemotherapy were randomly assigned to donepezil (n = 140) or placebo (n = 136). At 24 weeks, treatment groups did not differ on HVLT-R scores (donepezil mean = 25.98, placebo = 26.50, P = .32). There were no statistically significant differences between treatments at 12, 24, or 36 weeks for attention, executive function, verbal fluency, processing speed, or self-reported cognitive functioning. Endocrine therapy and menopausal status did not affect results.

Conclusion: BCS 1-5 years after completing chemotherapy with documented memory problems, randomly assigned to 24 weeks of 5-10 mg of donepezil once daily, did not perform differently at the end of treatment on tests of memory, other cognitive functions, or subjective functioning than those randomly assigned to placebo.",7/20/2024,JCO.23.01100,{}

Patients were enrolled on a three-arm randomized control trial (Blood and Marrow Transplants Clinical Trials Network 0702 Stem Cell Transplant for Myeloma in Combination of Novel Agents [STaMINA]; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01109004).

Methods: Four hundred and thirty-five patients consented to the MRD panel, which included 10 monoclonal antibodies measured via six-color MFC. MRD was measured at baseline/preautologous hematopoietic cell transplant (BL/preAutoHCT), premaintenance (PM), and 1 year (Y1) after AutoHCT with a sensitivity of 10–5 to 10–6. The primary objective was to assess MRD-negative (MRDneg) at 1 year after AutoHCT and progression-free survival and overall survival (PFS/OS).

Results: Similar to the STaMINA results, at a median follow-up of 70 months, there was no significant difference in PFS/OS by treatment arm in the PRIMeR patients. MRDneg at all three time points was associated with significantly improved PFS, and MRDneg at Y1 had significantly longer OS. Multivariate analysis of PFS, adjusting for disease risk and treatment arm, demonstrated hazard ratios (HRs) in MRD-positive patients compared with MRDneg patients at BL, PM, and Y1 of 1.55 (P = .0074), 1.83 (P = .0007), and 3.61 (P < .0001), respectively. Corresponding HRs for OS were 1.19 (P = .48), 0.88 (P = .68), and 3.36 (P < .001). Patients with sustained MRDneg or who converted to MRDneg by Y1 had similar PFS/OS.

Conclusion: To our knowledge, this first, prospective US cooperative group, multicenter study demonstrates that MRDneg at Y1 after AutoHCT with lenalidomide maintenance is prognostic for improved 6-year PFS and OS. Serial MRD measurements may direct trials to test how further therapy may improve long-term PFS and OS.",8/10/2024,JCO.23.00934,"{'Marcelo C.

Elective Pelvic Lymph Node Radiation Therapy and the Risk of Death in Patients With Unfavorable-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Postrandomization Analysis,Mutlay  Sayan; Ming-Hui  Chen; Marian  Loffredo; Elizabeth  McMahon; Shalini  Moningi; Peter F.  Orio; Paul L.  Nguyen; Anthony V.  D'Amico,MA; CT; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA,"Purpose: Although a contemporary randomized clinical trial has led to the use of whole-pelvic radiation therapy (WPRT), long-term data evaluating a potential reduction in mortality are lacking and are addressed in the current study.

Materials and Methods: From 2005 to 2015, 350 men with localized, unfavorable-risk prostate cancer (PC) were randomly assigned to receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and RT plus docetaxel versus ADT and RT. Treatment of the pelvic lymph nodes was at the discretion of the treating physician. Multivariable Cox and Fine and Grays regression analyses were performed to assess whether a significant association existed between radiation treatment volume and all-cause mortality (ACM) and PC-specific mortality (PCSM), respectively, adjusting for known PC prognostic factors and comorbidity. An interaction term between age (categorized by dichotomization at 65 years to enable clinical interpretation and applicability of the results and which approximates the median (66 years [IQR, 61-70]) and radiation treatment volume was included in the analysis.

Results: After a median follow-up of 10.20 years (IQR, 7.96-11.41), 89 men died (25.43%); of these, 42 died of PC (47.19%). Of the 350 randomly assigned patients, 88 (25.14%) received WPRT. In men younger than 65 years, WPRT was associated with a significantly lower ACM risk (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.33 [95% CI, 0.11 to 0.97]; P = .04) and lower PCSM risk (AHR, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.02 to 1.35]; P = .09) after adjusting for covariates, whereas this was not the case for men 65 years or older.

Patients and Methods: Adult subjects with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic, relapsed or refractory LMS were treated with escalating doses of unesbulin orally twice per week in combination with DTIC 1,000 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) once every 21 days. The time-to-event continual reassessment method was used to determine the RP2D on the basis of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) assessed during the first two 21-day treatment cycles. All explored doses of unesbulin (200 mg up to 400 mg) were in combination with DTIC. An expansion cohort was enrolled to evaluate the safety and efficacy of unesbulin at the RP2D.

Results: Unesbulin 300 mg administered orally twice per week in combination with DTIC 1,000 mg/m2 IV once every 21 days was identified as the RP2D. On the basis of data from 27 subjects who were deemed DLT-evaluable, toxicity was higher in the unesbulin 400 mg group, with three of four subjects (75%) experiencing DLTs versus one of four subjects (25%) in the 200 mg group and three of 19 subjects (15.8%) in the 300 mg group. The most commonly reported DLTs and treatment-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. At the RP2D, seven subjects who were efficacy evaluable achieved partial response for an objective response rate of 24.1%.

Conclusion: Unesbulin 300 mg twice per week plus DTIC 1,000 mg/m2 once every 21 days was identified as the RP2D, demonstrating a favorable benefit-risk profile in a heavily pretreated population of adults with advanced LMS.",7/10/2024,JCO.23.01684,"{'Brian A.

A randomized trial compared progression-free survival (PFS) after treatment with radiation therapy alone as compared with concurrent chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods: Between February 2008 and August 2020, 165 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either radiation treatment alone or a combination of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether chemoradiation therapy was more effective than radiation therapy alone at improving PFS.

Results: The majority of patients had low-grade (1 or 2) endometrioid histology (82%) and recurrences confined to the vagina (86%). External beam with either the three-dimensional or intensity modulated radiation treatment technique was followed by a boost delivered with brachytherapy or external beam. Patients randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy were treated with once weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m2). Rates of acute toxicity were higher in patients treated with chemoradiation as compared with radiation treatment alone. Median PFS was longer for patients treated with radiation therapy alone as compared with chemotherapy and radiation (median PFS was not reached for RT v 73 months for chemoradiation, hazard ratio of 1.25 (95% CI, 0.75 to 2.07). At 3 years, 73% of patients treated definitively with radiation and 62% of patients treated with chemoradiation were alive and free of disease progression.

Conclusion: Excellent outcomes can be achieved for women with localized recurrences of endometrial cancer when treated with radiation therapy. The addition of chemotherapy does not improve PFS for patients treated with definitive radiation therapy for recurrent endometrial cancer and increases acute toxicity. Patients with low-grade and vaginal recurrences who constituted the majority of those enrolled are best treated with radiation therapy alone.",7/10/2024,JCO.23.01279,"{'Matthew Powell': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Tesaro, Clovis Oncology, Eisai, GOG partners, Seagen, GlaxoSmithKline/Tesaro, Merck, Immunogen', 'Research Funding: GlaxoSmithKline/Tesaro (Inst)'], 'Julian C.

Patients and Methods: TROPION-PanTumor01 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03401385) is a phase I, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study evaluating Dato-DXd in patients with previously treated solid tumors. The primary study objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of Dato-DXd. Secondary objectives included evaluation of antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics. Results from patients with advanced/metastatic hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HR+/HER2–) breast cancer (BC) or triple-negative BC (TNBC) are reported.

Results: At data cutoff (July 22, 2022), 85 patients (HR+/HER2– BC = 41, and TNBC = 44) had received Dato-DXd. The objective response rate by blinded independent central review was 26.8% (95% CI, 14.2 to 42.9) and 31.8% (95% CI, 18.6 to 47.6) for patients with HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC, respectively. The median duration of response was not evaluable in the HR+/HER2– BC cohort and 16.8 months in the TNBC cohort. The median progression-free survival in patients with HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC was 8.3 and 4.4 months, respectively. All-cause treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; any grade, grade ≥3) were observed in 100% and 41.5% of patients with HR+/HER2– BC and 100% and 52.3% of patients with TNBC. Stomatitis was the most common TEAE (any grade, grade ≥3) in both HR+/HER2– BC (82.9%, 9.8%) and TNBC (72.7%, 11.4%) cohorts.

Conclusion: In patients with heavily pretreated advanced HR+/HER2– BC and TNBC, Dato-DXd demonstrated promising clinical activity and a manageable safety profile. Dato-DXd is currently being evaluated in phase III studies.",7/1/2024,JCO.23.01909,{}

Patients and Methods: Patients with SCLC and progression on or after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned (1:1) to intravenous (IV) liposomal irinotecan (70 mg/m2 every 2 weeks in a 6-week cycle) or IV topotecan (1.5 mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days, every 3 weeks in a 6-week cycle). The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Key secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR).

Results: Among 461 randomly assigned patients, 229 received liposomal irinotecan and 232 received topotecan. The median follow-up was 18.4 months. The median OS was 7.9 months with liposomal irinotecan versus 8.3 months with topotecan (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.37]; P = .31). The median PFS per blinded independent central review (BICR) was 4.0 months with liposomal irinotecan and 3.3 months with topotecan (HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.20]; nominal P = .71); ORR per BICR was 44.1% (95% CI, 37.6 to 50.8) and 21.6% (16.4 to 27.4), respectively. Overall, 42.0% and 83.4% of patients receiving liposomal irinotecan and topotecan, respectively, experienced grade ≥3 related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The most common grade ≥3 related TEAEs were diarrhea (13.7%), neutropenia (8.0%), and decreased neutrophil count (4.4%) with liposomal irinotecan and neutropenia (51.6%), anemia (30.9%), and leukopenia (29.1%) with topotecan.

Conclusion: Liposomal irinotecan and topotecan demonstrated similar median OS and PFS in patients with relapsed SCLC. Although the primary end point of OS was not met, liposomal irinotecan demonstrated a higher ORR than topotecan. The safety profile of liposomal irinotecan was consistent with its known safety profile; no new safety concerns emerged.",7/1/2024,JCO.23.02110,"{'David R.

The primary outcome measure was time to functional recovery. Secondary outcomes included morbidity, quality of life (QoL), and for those with cancer, resection margin status and time to adjuvant systemic therapy.

Patients and Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized controlled, patient-blinded, superiority trial on adult patients undergoing hemihepatectomy. Patients were recruited from 16 hospitals in Europe between November 2013 and December 2018.

Results: Of the 352 randomly assigned patients, 332 patients (94.3%) underwent surgery (laparoscopic, n = 166 and open, n = 166) and comprised the analysis population. The median time to functional recovery was 4 days (IQR, 3-5; range, 1-30) for laparoscopic hemihepatectomy versus 5 days (IQR, 4-6; range, 1-33) for open hemihepatectomy (difference, –17.5% [96% CI, –25.6 to –8.4]; P < .001). There was no difference in major complications (laparoscopic 24/166 [14.5%] v open 28/166 [16.9%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.84; P = .58). Regarding QoL, both global health status (difference, 3.2 points; P < .001) and body image (difference, 0.9 points; P < .001) scored significantly higher in the laparoscopic group. For the 281 (84.6%) patients with cancer, R0 resection margin status was similar (laparoscopic 106 [77.9%] v open 122 patients [84.1%], OR, 0.60; P = .14) with a shorter time to adjuvant systemic therapy in the laparoscopic group (46.5 days v 62.8 days, hazard ratio, 2.20; P = .009).

Conclusion: Among patients undergoing hemihepatectomy, the laparoscopic approach resulted in a shorter time to functional recovery compared with open surgery. In addition, it was associated with a better QoL, and in patients with cancer, a shorter time to adjuvant systemic therapy with no adverse impact on cancer outcomes observed.",5/20/2024,JCO.23.01019,{}

Yom,NY; CA; CA; NY; CA; NY; CA; CA; NY; CA; CA; CA,"Purpose: Locally advanced, unresectable basal cell carcinoma (LA BCC) can be treated with radiation therapy (RT), but locoregional control (LRC) rates are unsatisfactory. Vismodegib is a hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HPI) active in BCC that may radiosensitize BCC. We evaluated the combination of vismodegib and RT for patients with LA BCC.

Methods: In this multicenter, single-arm, phase II study, patients with unresectable LA BCC received 12 weeks of induction vismodegib, followed by 7 weeks of concurrent vismodegib and RT. The primary end point was LRC rate at 1 year after the end of treatment. Secondary end points included objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety, and patient-reported quality of life (PRQOL).

Results: Twenty-four patients received vismodegib; five were unable to complete 12 weeks of induction therapy. LRC was achieved in 91% (95% CI, 68 to 98) of patients at 1 year. The response rate was 63% (95% CI, 38 to 84) after induction vismodegib and 83% (95% CI, 59 to 96) after concurrent vismodegib and RT. With a median follow-up of 5.7 years, 1-year PFS and OS rates were 100% and 96%, and at 5 years PFS and OS rates were 78% and 83%, respectively. Distant metastasis or BCC-related death has not been observed. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were dysgeusia, fatigue, and myalgias occurring in 83%, 75%, and 75% of patients. No grade 4 to 5 treatment-related AEs occurred. PRQOL demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in all subscales, with emotions and functioning improvements persisting for a year after the end of treatment.

Mitoxantrone Versus Liposomal Daunorubicin in Induction of Pediatric AML With Risk Stratification Based on Flow Cytometry Measurement of Residual Disease,Anne  Tierens; Nira  Arad-Cohen; Daniel  Cheuk; Barbara  De Moerloose; Jose Maria  Fernandez Navarro; Henrik  Hasle; Kirsi  Jahnukainen; Kristian Løvvik  Juul-Dam; Gertjan  Kaspers; Zanna  Kovalova; Birgitte  Lausen; Ulrika  Norén-Nyström; Josefine  Palle; Ramune  Pasauliene; Cornelis  Jan Pronk; Kadri  Saks; Bernward  Zeller; Jonas  Abrahamsson,Canada; Israel; China; Belgium; Spain; Denmark; Finland; Denmark; the Netherlands; the Netherlands; Latvia; Denmark; Sweden; Sweden; Lithuania; Sweden; Estonia; Norway; Sweden,"Purpose: Measurable residual disease (MRD) by using flow cytometry after induction therapy is strongly prognostic in pediatric AML, and hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (hSCT) may counteract a poor response. We designed a phase III study with intensified response-guided induction and MRD-based risk stratification and treated poor induction response with hSCT. The efficacy of liposomal daunorubicin (DNX) in induction was compared with mitoxantrone.

Methods: The study planned to randomly assign 300 patients, but the production of DNX ceased in 2017. One hundred ninety-four patients were randomly assigned to mitoxantrone or experimental DNX in induction 1. Ninety-three non–randomly assigned patients served as an observation cohort. Primary end point was fraction of patients with MRD <0.1% on day 22 after induction 1. Patients with MRD ≥15% after induction 1 or ≥0.1% after induction 2 or FLT3-ITD with NPM1 wildtype were stratified to high-risk therapy, including hSCT.

Results: Outcome for all 287 children was good with 5-year event-free survival (EFS5y) 66.7% (CI, 61.4 to 72.4) and 5-year overall survival (OS5y) 79.6% (CI, 75.0 to 84.4). Overall, 75% were stratified to standard-risk and 19% to high-risk. There was no difference in the proportion of patients with MRD <0.1% on day 22 after induction 1 (34% mitoxantrone, etoposide, araC [MEC], 30% DNX, P = .65), but the proportion increased to 61% for MEC versus 47% for DNX (P = .061) at the last evaluation before induction 2. EFS5y was significantly lower, 56.6% (CI, 46.7 to 66.5) versus 71.9% (CI, 63.0 to 80.9), and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was higher, 35.1% (CI, 25.7 to 44.7) versus 18.8% (CI, 11.6 to 27.2) for DNX. The inferior outcome for DNX was only in standard-risk patients with EFS5y 55.3% (CI, 45.1 to 67.7) versus 79.9% (CI, 71.1 to 89.9), CIR 39.5% (CI, 28.4 to 50.3) versus 18.7% (CI, 10.5 to 28.7), and OS5y 76.2% (CI, 67.2 to 86.4) versus 88.6% (CI, 81.4 to 96.3). As-treated analyses, including the observation cohort, supported these results. For all high-risk patients, 85% received hSCT, and EFS5y was 77.7 (CI, 67.3 to 89.7) and OS5y was 83.0 (CI, 73.5 to 93.8).

Conclusion: The intensification of induction therapy with risk stratification on the basis of response to induction and hSCT for high-risk patients led to improved outcomes. Mitoxantrone had a superior anti-leukemic effect than liposomal daunorubicin.",6/20/2024,JCO.23.01841,{}
Impact of Propofol Exposure on Neurocognitive Outcomes in Children With High-Risk B ALL: A Children's Oncology Group Study,Sarah  Alexander; John A.

Hardy,Canada; FL; Canada; FL; DC; TN; TX; TN; MD; WI; CO; TN; TX; NY; PA; WA; DC,"Purpose: Many children treated for ALL develop long-term neurocognitive impairments. Increased risk of these impairments is associated with treatment and demographic factors. Exposure to anesthesia is an additional possible risk factor. This study evaluated the impact of cumulative exposure to anesthesia on neurocognitive outcomes among a multicenter cohort of children with ALL.

Methods: This study was embedded in AALL1131, a Children's Oncology Group phase III trial for patients with high-risk B-ALL. In consenting patients age 6-12 years, prospective uniform assessments of neurocognitive function were performed during and at 1 year after completion of therapy. Exposure to all episodes of anesthetic agents was abstracted. Multivariable linear regression models determined associations of cumulative anesthetic agents with the primary neurocognitive outcome reaction time/processing speed (age-normed) at 1 year off therapy, adjusting for baseline neurocognitive score, age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status (as a proxy for socioeconomic status), and leukemia risk group.

Results: One hundred and forty-four children, 76 (52.8%) males, mean age of 9.1 (min-max, 6.0-12.0) years at diagnosis, underwent a median of 27 anesthetic episodes (min-max, 1-37). Almost all patients were exposed to propofol (140/144, 97.2%), with a mean cumulative dose of 112.3 mg/kg. One year after therapy, the proportion of children with impairment (Z-score ≤–1.5) was significantly higher compared with a normative sample. In covariate-adjusted multivariable analysis, cumulative exposure to propofol was associated with a 0.05 Z-score decrease in reaction time/processing speed per each 10 mg/kg propofol exposure (P = .03).

Conclusion: In a multicenter and uniformly treated cohort of children with B-ALL, cumulative exposure to propofol was an independent risk factor for impairment in reaction time/processing speed 1 year after therapy. Anesthesia exposure is a modifiable risk, and opportunities to minimize propofol use should be considered.",8/1/2024,JCO.23.01989,"{'John A.

Methods: Patients enrolled in a single-arm phase II study. Pretreatment inguinal-femoral nodal assessment was performed. Sixty-four Gy IMRT was prescribed to the vulva, with 50-64 Gy delivered to the groins/low pelvis. Radiation therapy (RT) plans were quality-reviewed pretreatment. C 40 mg/m2 and G 50 mg/m2 were administered once per week throughout IMRT. Complete pathologic response (CPR) was the primary end point. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and adverse events were assessed with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0.

Results: Fifty-seven patients enrolled, of which 52 were evaluable. The median age was 58 years (range, 25-58), and 94% were White. Forty (77%) had stage II or III disease, and all had squamous histology. A median of six chemotherapy cycles (range, 1-8) were received. Eighty-five percent of RT plans were quality-reviewed with 100% compliance to protocol. Seven patients came off trial because of toxicity or patient withdrawal. Of 52 patients available for pathologic assessment, 38 (73% [90% CI, 61 to 83]) achieved CPR. No pelvic exenterations were performed. With a median follow-up of 51 months, the 12-month PFS was 74% (90% CI, 62.2 to 82.7) and the 24-month OS was 70% (90% CI, 57 to 79). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hematologic toxicity and radiation dermatitis. There was one grade 5 event unlikely related to treatment.

Conclusion: Weekly C and G concurrent with IMRT sufficiently improved CPR in women with locally advanced vulvar squamous cell carcinoma not amenable to surgical resection.",6/1/2024,JCO.23.02235,{}

This trial investigated whether 3 months of modified infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) or capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) as NAC could improve outcomes in patients with locally advanced colon cancer versus upfront surgery.

Patients and Methods: OPTICAL was a randomized, phase III trial in patients with clinically staged locally advanced colon cancer (T3 with extramural spread into the mesocolic fat ≥5 mm or T4). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive six preoperative cycles of mFOLFOX6 or four cycles of CAPOX, followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC group), or immediate surgery and the physician's choice of adjuvant chemotherapy (upfront surgery group). The primary end point was 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) assessed in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population.

Results: Between January 2016 and April 2021, of the 752 patients enrolled, 744 patients were included in the mITT analysis (371 in the NAC group; 373 in the upfront surgery group). At a median follow-up of 48.0 months (IQR, 46.0-50.1), 3-year DFS rates were 82.1% in the NAC group and 77.5% in the upfront surgery group (stratified hazard ratio [HR], 0.74 [95% CI, 0.54 to 1.03]). The R0 resection was achieved in 98% of patients who underwent surgery in both groups. Compared with upfront surgery, NAC resulted in a 7% pathologic complete response rate (pCR), significantly lower rates of advanced tumor staging (pT3-4: 77% v 94%), lymph node metastasis (pN1-2: 31% v 46%), and potentially improved overall survival (stratified HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.77]).

Conclusion: NAC with mFOLFOX6 or CAPOX did not show a significant DFS benefit. However, this neoadjuvant approach was safe, resulted in substantial pathologic downstaging, and appears to be a viable therapeutic option for locally advanced colon cancer.",9/1/2024,JCO.23.01889,{}

CONTACT-01 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04471428) evaluated atezolizumab plus cabozantinib versus docetaxel in patients with metastatic NSCLC who developed disease progression after concurrent or sequential treatment with anti–PD-L1/PD-1 and platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Methods: This multicenter, open-label, phase III trial randomly assigned patients 1:1 to atezolizumab 1,200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks (q3w) plus cabozantinib 40 mg orally once daily or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously once every 3 weeks. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).

Results: One hundred eighty-six patients were assigned atezolizumab plus cabozantinib, and 180 docetaxel. Minimum OS follow-up was 10.9 months. Median OS was 10.7 months (95% CI, 8.8 to 12.3) with atezolizumab plus cabozantinib and 10.5 months (95% CI, 8.6 to 13.0) with docetaxel (stratified hazard ratio [HR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.16]; P = .3668). Median progression-free survival was 4.6 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 5.6) and 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.1 to 4.4), respectively (stratified HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.92]). Serious adverse events (AEs) occurred in 71 (38.4%) patients receiving atezolizumab plus cabozantinib and 58 (34.7%) receiving docetaxel. Grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 73 (39.5%) patients receiving atezolizumab plus cabozantinib and 58 (34.7%) receiving docetaxel. Grade 5 AEs occurred in 14 (7.6%) and 10 (6.0%) patients in the atezolizumab plus cabozantinib and docetaxel arms, respectively (treatment-related in four [2.2%] and one [0.6%], respectively).

Conclusion: Atezolizumab plus cabozantinib after disease progression following anti–PD-L1/PD-1 immunotherapy and platinum-containing chemotherapy for metastatic NSCLC did not improve OS compared with docetaxel.

This study examined the efficacy and durability of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on perceived CRCI in cancer survivors.

Methods: Atlantic Canadian cancer survivors with insomnia and CRCI were randomly assigned to receive seven weekly virtual CBT-I sessions (n = 63) or placed in a waitlist control group (n = 69) to receive treatment after the waiting period. Participants completed assessments at baseline, 1 month (mid-treatment), and 2 months (post-treatment). Age- and education-adjusted mixed-effects models using intention-to-treat principles assessed change at post-treatment. Data from both groups were then pooled to assess the durability of effects at 3 and 6 months. A mediation analysis examined whether change in insomnia symptoms mediated the effect of CBT-I on cognitive outcomes.

Results: The mean age of the sample was 60 years, 77% were women, and breast cancer was the most common diagnosis (41%). The treatment group reported an 11.35-point reduction in insomnia severity, compared with a 2.67-point reduction in the waitlist control group (P < .001). The treatment group had a greater overall improvement than the waitlist control on perceived cognitive impairment (P < .001; d = 0.75), cognitive abilities (P < .001; d = 0.92), and impact on quality of life (P < .001; d = 1.01). These improvements were maintained at follow-up. Change in insomnia symptoms fully mediated the effect of CBT-I on subjective cognitive outcomes.

Conclusion: Treating insomnia with CBT-I produces clinically meaningful and durable improvements in CRCI.

Methods: Post-/pre-/perimenopausal women, or men, age 18 years or older with measurable disease/evaluable bone lesions, whose disease progressed after 1-2 lines of systemic therapy (≤1 targeted, ≤1 chemotherapy regimen, prior fulvestrant allowed) were randomly assigned 1:1 to giredestrant (30 mg oral once daily) or fulvestrant/aromatase inhibitor per local guidelines (+luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone agonist in pre-/perimenopausal women, and men) until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. Stratification was by visceral versus nonvisceral disease, prior cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, and prior fulvestrant. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (INV-PFS).

Results: At clinical cutoff (February 18, 2022; median follow-up: 7.9 months; N = 303), the INV-PFS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.10; P = .1757). In the prespecified secondary end point analysis of INV-PFS by ESR1 mutation (m) status in circulating tumor DNA–evaluable patients (n = 232), the HR in patients with a detectable ESR1m (n = 90) was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.35 to 1.03) versus 0.88 (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.42) in patients with no ESR1m detected (n = 142). Related grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and discontinuations due to AEs were balanced across arms.

Conclusion: Although the acelERA BC study did not reach statistical significance for its primary INV-PFS end point, there was a consistent treatment effect with giredestrant across most key subgroups and a trend toward favorable benefit among patients with ESR1-mutated tumors. Giredestrant was well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to PCET and consistent with known endocrine therapy risks.

Pazopanib is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and other kinases that improves progression-free survival in patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC). We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study to test whether pazopanib would improve disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with mRCC rendered NED after metastasectomy.

Patients and Methods: Patients with NED after metastasectomy were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive pazopanib 800 mg once daily versus placebo for 52 weeks. The study was designed to observe an improvement in DFS from 25% to 45% with pazopanib at 3 years, corresponding to 42% reduction in the DFS event rate.

Results: From August 2012 to July 2017, 129 patients were enrolled. The study was unblinded after 83 DFS events (92% information). The study did not meet its primary end point. An updated analysis at 60.5-month median follow-up from random assignment (95% CI, 59.3 to 71.0) showed that the 3-year DFS was 27.4% (95% CI, 17.9 to 41.7) for pazopanib and 21.9% (95% CI, 13.3 to 36.2) for placebo. Hazard ratio (HR) for DFS was 0.90 ([95% CI, 0.60 to 1.34]; Pone-sided = .29) in favor of pazopanib. Three-year overall survival (OS) was 81.9% (95% CI, 72.7 to 92.2) for pazopanib and 91.4% (95% CI, 84.4 to 98.9) for placebo. The HR for OS was 2.55 (95% CI, 1.23 to 5.27) in favor of placebo (Ptwo-sided = .012). Health-related quality-of-life measures deteriorated in the pazopanib group during the treatment period.

Conclusion: Pazopanib did not improve DFS as the primary end point compared with blinded placebo in patients with mRCC with NED after metastasectomy. In addition, there was a concerning trend favoring placebo in OS.",6/10/2024,JCO.23.01544,{}

Methods: The randomized multicenter phase II PACE trial enrolled patients with hormone receptor–positive/HER2– MBC whose disease had progressed on previous CDK4/6i and aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy. Patients were randomly assigned 1:2:1 to receive fulvestrant (F), fulvestrant plus palbociclib (F + P), or fulvestrant plus palbociclib and avelumab (F + P + A). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with F versus F + P.

Results: Overall, 220 patients were randomly assigned between September 2017 and February 2022. The median age was 57 years (range, 25-83 years). Most patients were postmenopausal (80.9%), and 40% were originally diagnosed with de novo MBC. Palbociclib was the most common previous CDK4/6i (90.9%). The median PFS was 4.8 months on F and 4.6 months on F + P (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11 [90% CI, 0.79 to 1.55]; P = .62). The median PFS on F + P + A was 8.1 months (HR v F, 0.75 [90% CI, 0.50 to 1.12]; P = .23). The difference in PFS with F + P and F + P + A versus F was greater among patients with baseline ESR1 and PIK3CA alterations.

Conclusion: The addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant did not improve PFS versus fulvestrant alone among patients with hormone receptor–positive/HER2– MBC whose disease had progressed on a previous CDK4/6i plus AI. The increased PFS seen with the addition of avelumab warrants further investigation in this patient population.",6/10/2024,JCO.23.01940,"{'Erica L.

Methods: MyHealth is a phase III randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02949167). Patients, who recently completed primary treatment for stage I-II breast cancer, were randomly assigned in variable block sizes and stratified by age and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status to intervention or control follow-up. The nurse-led intervention comprised three to five individual self-management sessions, regular reporting of symptoms, and navigation to health care services. The control follow-up comprised regular outpatient visits with the physician. The primary outcome was breast cancer–specific quality of life (QoL) measured by the Trial Outcome Index-Physical/Functional/Breast summary score of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast 2 years after random assignment. Secondary outcomes were fear of recurrence, anxiety, depression, and health care utilization. Analyses were intention-to-treat and P values were two-sided with 95% confidence level set at 0.005 because of multiple comparisons.

Results: Among 1,101 eligible patients, 875 were invited and 503 were randomly assigned to control (n = 252) or intervention (n = 251) follow-up. At 2 years, patients in the intervention group reported a significantly and clinically relevant higher QoL (mean, 75.69 [standard deviation [SD], 12.27]) than patients in the control group (71.26 [SD, 14.08]), with a mean difference of 5.05 (95% CI, 3.30 to 6.79; P < .001). The intervention group reported significantly less fear of recurrence, anxiety, and depression; they had fewer physician consultations but more nurse contacts and an unchanged diagnostic imaging pattern. The effect on all outcomes was stable through a 3-year follow-up.

Conclusion: The MyHealth study suggested a new strategy for follow-up after early breast cancer as it provided significant improvements in QoL.",6/10/2024,JCO.23.01447,"{'Lena Saltbæk': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: AstraZeneca'], 'Beverley L.

These patients are routinely treated with a FLT3 inhibitor after HCT, but there is limited evidence to support this. Accordingly, we conducted a randomized trial of post-HCT maintenance with the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02997202) to determine if all such patients benefit or if detection of measurable residual disease (MRD) could identify those who might benefit.

Methods: Adults with FLT3-ITD AML in first remission underwent HCT and were randomly assigned to placebo or 120 mg once daily gilteritinib for 24 months after HCT. The primary end point was relapse-free survival (RFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and the effect of MRD pre- and post-HCT on RFS and OS.

Results: Three hundred fifty-six participants were randomly assigned post-HCT to receive gilteritinib or placebo. Although RFS was higher in the gilteritinib arm, the difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR], 0.679 [95% CI, 0.459 to 1.005]; two-sided P = .0518). However, 50.5% of participants had MRD detectable pre- or post-HCT, and, in a prespecified subgroup analysis, gilteritinib was beneficial in this population (HR, 0.515 [95% CI, 0.316 to 0.838]; P = .0065). Those without detectable MRD showed no benefit (HR, 1.213 [95% CI, 0.616 to 2.387]; P = .575).

Conclusion: Although the overall improvement in RFS was not statistically significant, RFS was higher for participants with detectable FLT3-ITD MRD pre- or post-HCT who received gilteritinib treatment. To our knowledge, these data are among the first to support the effectiveness of MRD-based post-HCT therapy.",5/20/2024,JCO.23.02474,"{'Mark J.

We investigated the potential prognostic and predictive value of HER2 amplification and gene expression using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and NanoString data.

Patients and Methods: Primary tumor DNA from 559 patients was profiled for HER2 amplification by NGS (FoundationOne CDx). Tumor tissue from 925 patients was tested for NanoString gene expression using an 800-gene panel. OS and progression-free survival (PFS) were the time-to-event end points.

Results: High HER2 expression (dichotomized at median) was associated with longer PFS (11.6 v 10 months, P = .012) and OS (32 v 25.3 months, P = .033), independent of treatment. An OS benefit for cetuximab versus bevacizumab was observed in the high HER2 expression group (P = .02), whereas a worse PFS for cetuximab was seen in the low-expression group (P = .019). When modeled as a continuous variable, increased HER2 expression was associated with longer OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.93]; adjusted P = .0007) and PFS (HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74 to 0.91]; adjusted P = .0002), reaching a plateau effect after the median. In patients with HER2 expression lower than median, treatment with cetuximab was associated with worse PFS (HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.12 to 1.71]; adjusted P = .0027) and OS (HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.59]; adjusted P = .03) compared with that with bevacizumab. A significant interaction between HER2 expression and the treatment arm was observed for OS (Pintx = .017), PFS (Pintx = .048), and objective response rate (Pintx = .001).

Conclusion: HER2 gene expression was prognostic and predictive in CALGB/SWOG 80405. HER2 tumor expression may inform treatment selection for patients with low HER2 favoring bevacizumab- versus cetuximab-based therapies.",6/1/2024,JCO.23.01507,"{'Francesca Battaglin': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Caris Life Sciences'], 'Xueping Qu': ['Employment: Genentech, BeiGene', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Genentech/Roche, BeiGene'], 'Howard S.

Methods: From January 2012 to September 2016, we conducted a community-based cluster randomized controlled trial involving permanent residents age 45-69 years in a high-risk region for ESCC in northern China. A total of 668 targeted villages were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the screening group (offered Lugol's chromoendoscopy) or control group (no screening). Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed to compare esophageal cancer (EC) incidence and mortality between the two groups. The per-protocol analysis adjusted for nonadherence to the screening procedure.

Results: A total of 33,847 participants were included in the analysis: 17,104 in the screening group, 15,165 (88.7%) of whom underwent screening, and 16,743 in the control group. During a maximum follow-up of 9 years, EC incidence in the screening and control groups were 60.9 and 72.5 per 100,000 person-years, respectively; mortality in the screening and control groups were 29.7 and 32.4 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Compared with the control group, the incidence and mortality of the screening group reduced by 19% (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.09]) and 18% (aHR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.53 to 1.26]), respectively, in the intention-to-treat analysis; and by 22% (aHR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.56 to 1.10]) and 21% (aHR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.49 to 1.30]), respectively, in the per-protocol analysis.

Conclusion: With a 9-year follow-up, our trial suggests that chromoendoscopic screening induces modest reductions in EC incidence and mortality. A more efficient strategy for EC screening and subsequent patient management should be established to guarantee the effectiveness of endoscopic screening.",5/10/2024,JCO.23.01284,{}

Suzman,MD; MD; MD; MD; MD; NJ; MD; Japan; MD; MD; MD; MD; MD; MD; United Kingdom; MD; MD; MD; MD; MD; MD; MD,"Purpose: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved talazoparib with enzalutamide for first-line treatment of patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

Patients and Methods: The approval was based on the HRR gene-mutated (HRRm) population of TALAPRO-2, a randomized, double-blind trial that randomly assigned 1,035 patients with mCRPC to receive enzalutamide with either talazoparib or placebo. Two cohorts enrolled sequentially: an all-comer population (Cohort 1), followed by an HRRm-only population (Cohort 2). The independent primary end points were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per blinded independent central review (BICR) in Cohort 1 (all-comers) and in the combined HRRm population (all HRRm patients from Cohorts 1 and 2). Overall survival (OS) was a key secondary end point.

Results: A statistically significant improvement in rPFS by BICR was demonstrated in both the all-comers cohort and the combined HRRm population, with hazard ratio (HR) of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.78; P < .0001) and 0.45 (95% CI, 0.33 to 0.61; P < .0001), respectively. In an exploratory analysis of the 155 patients with BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) mCRPC, rPFS HR was 0.20 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.36). In the non-HRRm/unknown stratum of Cohort 1 (n = 636), the rPFS HR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.89). OS was immature.

Conclusion: Despite a statistically significant rPFS improvement in the all-comer cohort, FDA did not consider the magnitude of rPFS clinically meaningful in the context of the broad indication, combination treatment, and safety profile. Approval was therefore limited to patients with HRRm mCRPC, for whom there was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in rPFS and favorable OS results. This represents the first approval for the first-line treatment of patients with HRRm mCRPC.",5/20/2024,JCO.23.02182,"{'Erik Bloomquist': ['Employment: Merck', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Merck'], 'Salaheldin Hamed': ['Employment: Astellas Pharma'], 'Abdelrahmman Abukhdeir': ['Employment: AstraZeneca'], 'Daniel L.

Methods: Patients with either MRD (≥1 log10 rise) or oligoblastic relapse (blasts 5%-15%) received venetoclax 600 mg once daily D1-28 plus LDAC once daily D1-10 in 28-day cycles. The primary objective was MRD response in the MRD relapse cohort or complete remission (CR/CRh/CRi) in the oligoblastic relapse cohort.

Results: Forty-eight adults with either MRD (n = 26) or oligoblastic (n = 22) relapse were enrolled. Median age was 67 years (range, 18-80) and 94% had received previous intensive chemotherapy. Patients received a median of four cycles of therapy; 17% completed ≥12 cycles. Patients with oligoblastic relapse had more grade ≥3 anemia (32% v 4%; P = .02) and infections (36% v 8%; P = .03), whereas grade 4 neutropenia (32 v 23%) or thrombocytopenia (27 v 15%) were comparable with the MRD relapse cohort. Markers of molecular MRD relapse included mutant NPM1 (77%), CBFB::MYH11 (4%), RUNX1::RUNX1T1 (4%), or KMT2A::MLLT3 (4%). Three patients with a log10 rise in IDH1/2 (12%) were included. By cycle 2 in the MRD relapse cohort, a log10 reduction in MRD was observed in 69%; 46% achieved MRD negative remission. In the oligoblastic relapse cohort, 73% achieved CR/CRh/CRi. Overall, 21 (44%) underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached in either cohort. Estimated 2-year OS rate was 67% (95% CI, 50 to 89) in the MRD and 53% (95% CI, 34 to 84) in the oligoblastic relapse cohorts.

Data from nonrandomized clinical trials have fueled persistent uncertainty if primary tumor resection (PTR) before chemotherapy prolongs survival. We investigated the prognostic value of PTR in patients with newly diagnosed stage IV colon cancer who were not amenable to curative treatment.

Patients and Methods: Patients enrolled in the multicenter, randomized SYNCHRONOUS and CCRe-IV trials were included in the analysis. Patients with colon cancer with synchronous unresectable metastases were randomly assigned at 100 sites in Austria, Germany, and Spain to undergo PTR or up-front chemotherapy (No PTR group). The chemotherapy regimen was left at discretion of the local team. Patients with tumor-related symptoms, inability to tolerate surgery and/or systemic chemotherapy, and history of another cancer were excluded. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), and the analyses were performed with intention-to-treat.

Results: A total of 393 patients were randomly assigned to undergo PTR (n = 187) or no PTR (n = 206) between November 2011 and March 2017. Chemotherapy was not administered to 6.4% in the No PTR group and 24.1% in the PTR group. The median follow-up time was 36.7 months (95% CI, 36.6 to 37.3). The median OS was 16.7 months (95% CI, 13.2 to 19.2) in the PTR group and 18.6 months (95% CI, 16.2 to 22.3) in the No PTR group (P = .191). Comparable OS between the study groups was further confirmed on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.944 [95% CI, 0.738 to 1.209], P = .65) and across all subgroups. Patients with serious adverse events were more common in the No PTR group (10.2% v 18.0%; P = .027).

Conclusion: Among patients with colon cancer and synchronous unresectable metastases, PTR before systemic chemotherapy was not associated with prolonged OS.",5/1/2024,JCO.23.01540,{}
Topical Diclofenac for Prevention of Capecitabine-Associated Hand-Foot Syndrome: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial,Akhil  Santhosh; Atul  Sharma; Sameer  Bakhshi; Akash  Kumar; Vinod  Sharma; Prabhat Singh  Malik; Raja  Pramanik; Ajay  Gogia; Chandra Prakash  Prasad; Tushar  Sehgal; Sneha  Gund; Arundhathi  Dev; Winson Y.

Celecoxib prevents HFS by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) that is upregulated because of the underlying associated inflammation. However, systemic side effects of celecoxib have limited routine prescription. Topical diclofenac inhibits COX-2 locally with minimal risk of systemic adverse events. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the efficacy of topical diclofenac in the prevention of capecitabine-induced HFS.

Methods: In this single-site phase III randomized double-blind trial, we enrolled patients with breast or GI cancer who were planned to receive capecitabine-based treatment. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive topical diclofenac or placebo gel for 12 weeks or until the development of HFS, whichever occurred earlier. The primary end point was the incidence of grade 2 or 3 HFS (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5), which was compared between the two groups using simple logistic regression.

Results: In total, 264 patients were randomly assigned to receive topical diclofenac gel (n = 131) or placebo (n = 133). Grade 2 or 3 HFS was observed in 3.8% of participants in the diclofenac group compared with 15.0% in the placebo group (absolute difference, 11.2%; 95% CI, 4.3 to 18.1; P = .003). Grade 1-3 HFS was lower in the diclofenac group than in the placebo group (6.1% v 18.1%; absolute risk difference, 11.9%; 95% CI, 4.1 to 19.6). Capecitabine dose reductions because of HFS were less frequent in the diclofenac group (3.8%) than in the placebo group (13.5%; absolute risk difference, 9.7%; 95% CI, 3.0 to 16.4).

Conclusion: Topical diclofenac prevented HFS in patients receiving capecitabine. This trial supports the use of topical diclofenac to prevent capecitabine-associated HFS.",5/20/2024,JCO.23.01730,{}

Patients and Methods: Approval was based on EMERALD (Study RAD1901-308), a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter trial in 478 patients with ER+, HER2– advanced or metastatic breast cancer, including 228 patients with ESR1 mutations. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either elacestrant 345 mg orally once daily (n = 239) or investigator's choice of ET (n = 239).

Results: In the ESR1-mut subgroup, EMERALD demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review assessment (n = 228; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55 [95% CI, 0.39 to 0.77]; P value = .0005). Although the overall survival (OS) end point was not met, there was no trend toward a potential OS detriment (HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.63 to 1.30]) in the ESR1-mut subgroup. PFS also reached statistical significance in the intention-to-treat population (ITT, N = 478; HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88]; P value = .0018). However, improvement in PFS in the ITT population was primarily attributed to results from patients in the ESR1-mut subgroup. More patients who received elacestrant experienced nausea, vomiting, and dyslipidemia.

Conclusion: The approval of elacestrant in ER+, HER2– advanced or metastatic breast cancer was restricted to patients with ESR1 mutations. Benefit-risk assessment in the ESR1-mut subgroup was favorable on the basis of a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the context of an acceptable safety profile including no evidence of a potential detriment in OS. By contrast, the benefit-risk assessment in patients without ESR1 mutations was not favorable. Elacestrant is the first oral estrogen receptor antagonist to receive FDA approval for patients with ESR1 mutations.",4/1/2024,JCO.23.02112,{}

Methods: A prospective, open-label, randomized phase III MITO-23 trial evaluated the activity and safety of trabectedin 1.3 mg/m2 given once every 3 weeks (arm A) in BRCA 1/2 mutation carriers or patients with BRCAness phenotype (ie, patients who responded to ≥two previous platinum-based treatments) with recurrent OC, primary peritoneal carcinoma, or fallopian tube cancer in comparison with physician's choice chemotherapy in the control arm (arm B; pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, gemcitabine, once-weekly paclitaxel, or carboplatin). The primary end point was overall survival (OS) evaluated in the intention-to-treat population.

Results: Overall, 244 patients from 21 MITO centers were randomly assigned (arm A = 122/arm B = 122). More than 70% of patients received ≥three previous chemotherapy lines and 35.7% had received a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) before enrollment. Median OS was not significantly different between the arms: arm A: 15.8 versus arm B: 17.9 months (P = .304). Median progression-free survival was 4.9 months in arm A versus 4.4 months in arm B (P = .897). Among 208 patients evaluable for efficacy, the objective response rate was 17.1% in arm A and 21.4% in arm B, with comparable median duration of response (5.62 v 5.66 months, respectively). No superior effect was observed for trabectedin in the prespecified subgroup analyses according to BRCA mutational status, chemotherapy type, and pretreatment with a PARPi and/or platinum-free interval. Trabectedin showed a higher frequency of grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and serious adverse drug reactions compared with control chemotherapy.

Conclusion: Trabectedin did not improve median OS and showed a worse safety profile in comparison with physician's choice control chemotherapy.",5/1/2024,JCO.23.01225,"{'Domenica Lorusso': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: PharmaMar, AstraZeneca, Clovis Oncology, GlaxoSmithKline, MSD, Genmab, Seagen, Immunogen, Oncoinvest, Corcept Therapeutics, Sutro Biopharma, Novartis', ""Speakers' Bureau: AstraZeneca, Clovis Oncology, GlaxoSmithKline, MSD, PharmaMar, ImmunoGen, Seagen, Genmab"", 'Research Funding: PharmaMar (Inst), Clovis Oncology (Inst), GlaxoSmithKline (Inst), MSD (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Genmab (Inst), Seagen (Inst), Immunogen (Inst), Incyte (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Roche (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: AstraZeneca, Clovis Oncology, GlaxoSmithKline', 'Uncompensated Relationships: Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup'], 'Francesco Raspagliesi': ['Honoraria: GlaxoSmithKline, MSD Oncology', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca/Merck (Inst)', 'Research Funding: AstraZeneca (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: GlaxoSmithKline'], 'Giorgio Valabrega': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Eisai, MSD', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: GlaxoSmithKline, Eisai', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: MSD'], 'Nicoletta Colombo': ['Employment: Sarepta Therapeutics', 'Honoraria: Roche/Genentech, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, MSD Oncology, Clovis Oncology, Immunogen, Mersana, Eisai, Nuvation Bio, OncXerna, Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Novocure', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche/Genentech, AstraZeneca, Clovis Oncology, MSD Oncology, GlaxoSmithKline, Immunogen, Mersana, Eisai, Nuvation Bio, OncXerna, Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Novocure', ""Speakers' Bureau: AstraZeneca, Clovis Oncology, GlaxoSmithKline, MSD Oncology, Eisai"", 'Research Funding: AstraZeneca (Inst), Roche (Inst), GlaxoSmithKline (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Corcept Therapeutics'], 'Carmela Pisano': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, MSD Oncology'], 'Germana Tognon': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: GlaxoSmithKline, MSD'], 'Giorgia Mangili': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: MSD, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Clovis Oncology', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: MSD Oncology, GlaxoSmithKline'], 'Ugo De Giorgi': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Pfizer, Janssen, Astellas Pharma, Bristol Myers Squibb, Bayer, Ipsen, MSD, PharmaMar, Novartis, Dompé Farmaceutici, Clovis Oncology, AstraZeneca, Eisai, Amgen, the healthcare business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, Merck & Co, Kenilworth, NJ', 'Research Funding: Sanofi (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Roche (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Ipsen, Pfizer, AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo'], 'Claudia Andreetta': ['Honoraria: GlaxoSmithKline, PharmaMar, Clovis Oncology', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, BMS, MSD, Sanofi, Seagen', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: PharmaMar, Gilead Sciences, Pierre Fabre'], 'Antonio Frassoldati': ['Employment: Lilly', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, Seagen, Gilead Sciences, Daiichi Sankyo/Astra Zeneca', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Novartis'], 'Vanda Salutari': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, MSD Oncology, GlaxoSmithKline, PharmaMar, Novocure', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Novocure', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: GlaxoSmithKline, PharmaMar'], 'Giovanni Scambia': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Clovis Oncology, AstraZeneca, PharmaMar, Roche, Tesaro', ""Speakers' Bureau: Clovis Oncology, MSD""]}"

Methods: Eight hundred eighteen patients (age 1-18 years) with ALL were enrolled in the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group-ALL11 protocol and received PEGasp. Three hundred twelve patients stratified in the medium-risk arm were randomly assigned to receive 14 individualized PEGasp doses once every two weeks in either a noncontinuous or continuous schedule after the first three doses in induction (EudraCT: 2012-000067-25). Hypersensitivity reactions were defined as allergies, allergic-like reactions, and silent inactivation. Secondary end points were other asparaginase-related toxicities, asparaginase activity and antibody levels, and outcome.

Results: During induction, 27 of 818 patients (3.3%) experienced hypersensitivity reactions. After random assignment, 4 of 155 (2.6%) in the continuous treatment arm versus 17 of 157 (10.8%) patients in the noncontinuous treatment arm had hypersensitivity reactions (P < .01), of which two (1.3%) versus 13 (8.3%) were inactivating reactions (P < .01). The occurrence of inactivating hypersensitivity reactions was seven times lower in the continuous arm (odds ratio, 0.15 [0.032-0.653]). In addition, antibody levels were significantly lower in the continuous arm (P < .01). With exception of a lower incidence of increased amylase in the continuous arm, there were no significant differences in total number of asparaginase-associated toxicities between arms. However, the timing of the toxicities was associated with the timing of the asparaginase administrations. No difference in 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse, death, or disease-free survival was found between both treatment arms.

Conclusion: A continuous dosing schedule of PEGasp is an effective approach to prevent antibody formation and inactivating hypersensitivity reactions. The continuous PEGasp schedule did not increase toxicity and did not affect the efficacy of the therapy.",5/10/2024,JCO.23.01797,"{'Inge M. van der Sluis': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Clinigen Group (Inst), Jazz Pharmaceuticals (Inst)', ""Speakers' Bureau: Servier (Inst)"", 'Research Funding: Servier (Inst), Amgen (Inst)'], 'Leiah J.

The patient-reported outcome primary hypothesis was that OL-treated patients may experience greater fatigue during treatment.

Methods: Data were collected before random assignment, and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The primary end point was fatigue, measured with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale. Secondary end points, assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Core 30 item, included nausea and vomiting (NV), diarrhea, and multiple functional domains. Scores were compared between treatment groups using mixed model for repeated measures. Two-sided P values <.05 were statistically significant for the primary end point. All secondary end points were descriptive.

Results: One thousand five hundred and thirty-eight patients (NACT: 746, ACT: 792) contributed to the analysis. Fatigue severity was statistically significantly greater for OL versus PL, but not clinically meaningfully different by prespecified criteria (≥3 points) at 6 months (diff OL v PL: NACT: –1.3 [95% CI, –2.4 to –0.2]; P = .022; ACT: –1.3 [95% CI, –2.3 to –0.2]; P = .017) and 12 months (NACT: –1.6 [95% CI, –2.8 to –0.3]; P = .017; ACT: –1.3 [95% CI, –2.4 to –0.2]; P = .025). There were no significant differences in fatigue severity between treatment groups at 18 and 24 months. NV severity was worse in patients treated with OL compared with PL at 6 months (NACT: 6.0 [95% CI, 4.1 to 8.0]; ACT: 5.3 [95% CI, 3.4 to 7.2]) and 12 months (NACT: 6.4 [95% CI, 4.4 to 8.3]; ACT: 4.5 [95% CI, 2.8 to 6.1]). During treatment, there were some clinically meaningful differences between groups for other symptoms but not for function subscales or global health status.

Conclusion: Treatment-emergent symptoms from OL were limited, generally resolving after treatment ended. OL- and PL-treated patients had similar functional scores, slowly improving during the 24 months after (N)ACT and there was no clinically meaningful persistence of fatigue severity in OL-treated patients.",4/10/2024,JCO.23.01214,{}

However, FLT3 mutations are a common mechanism of resistance to this regimen. The addition of gilteritinib, an oral FLT3 inhibitor, to azacitidine and venetoclax may improve outcomes in patients with FLT3-mutated AML.

Methods: This phase I/II study evaluated azacitidine, venetoclax, and gilteritinib in two cohorts: patients with (1) newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML who were unfit for intensive chemotherapy or (2) relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutated AML (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04140487). The primary end points were the maximum tolerated dose of gilteritinib (phase I) and the combined complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) rate (phase II).

Results: Fifty-two patients were enrolled (frontline [n = 30]; relapsed/refractory [n = 22]). The recommended phase II dose was gilteritinib 80 mg once daily in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax. In the frontline cohort, the median age was 71 years and 73% of patients had an FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation. The CR/CRi rate was 96% (CR, 90%; CRi, 6%). Sixty-five percent of evaluable patients achieved FLT3-ITD measurable residual disease <5 × 10–5 within four cycles. With a median follow-up of 19.3 months, the median relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) have not been reached and the 18-month RFS and OS rates are 71% and 72%, respectively. In the relapsed/refractory cohort, the CR/CRi rate was 27%; nine additional patients (41%) achieved a morphologic leukemia–free state. The most common grade 3 or higher nonhematologic adverse events were infection (62%) and febrile neutropenia (38%), which were more frequent in the relapsed/refractory cohort.

Conclusion: The combination of azacitidine, venetoclax, and gilteritinib resulted in high rates of CR/CRi, deep FLT3 molecular responses, and encouraging survival in newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML.

Apalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AAP) prolong survival in the metastatic setting. We evaluated whether intensification of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) improves outcomes in BRPC.

Patients and Methods: PRESTO is a randomized phase III, open-label trial in patients with BRPC and PSA doubling time ≤9 months (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03009981). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive a finite 52-week treatment course with ADT control, ADT + apalutamide, or ADT + apalutamide + AAP. The primary end point was PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), defined as serum PSA >0.2 ng/mL after treatment completion.

Results: Five hundred three patients were enrolled. The median PSA was 1.8 ng/mL (IQR, 1.0-3.6). At the first planned interim analysis, both experimental arms significantly prolonged PSA-PFS compared with the control arm (median, 24.9 months for ADT + apalutamide v 20.3 months for ADT; hazard ratio [HR], 0.52 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.77]; P = .00047; median, 26.0 months for ADT + apalutamide + AAP v 20.0 months for ADT; HR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.32 to 0.71]; P = .00008). Median time to testosterone recovery did not differ across treatment arms. The most common grade ≥3 adverse event was hypertension (7.5%, 7.4%, and 18% in ADT, ADT + apalutamide, and ADT + apalutamide + AAP arms, respectively).

Conclusion: Intensified AR blockade for a finite duration prolongs PSA-PFS with a manageable safety profile, without adversely affecting time to testosterone recovery. The addition of apalutamide to ADT should be considered in patients with high-risk BRPC.",4/1/2024,JCO.23.01157,"{'Rahul Aggarwal': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Pfizer, Merck, Amgen, Jubilant Pharmaceuticals, Alessa Therapeutics, Exelixis, Bayer, Tersera, OncLive, BioXcel Therapeutics, Janssen, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Boxer Capital, EcoR1 Capital, PCCTC', 'Research Funding: Zenith Epigenetics (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Xynomic Pharma (Inst), Janssen (Inst), Merck (Inst), Amgen (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst)', 'Expert Testimony: University of Utah Health', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: DAVA Oncology'], 'Joel Picus': ['Research Funding: Seagen (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Merck (Inst), Lava Therapeutics (Inst)'], 'Mary-Ellen Taplin': ['Honoraria: Janssen-Ortho, Clovis Oncology, UpToDate, Research to Practice, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Roivant, AbbVie, Arcus Biosciences, Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Epizyme, Targeted Oncology, Arvinas, Blue Earth Diagnostics, Hengrui Therapeutics, Propella Therapeutics', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen-Ortho, Bayer, Best Doctors, Inc, UpToDate, Clovis Oncology, Research to Practice, Myovant Sciences, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Arcus Ventures', 'Research Funding: Janssen-Ortho (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Advanced Prostate Cancer Society'], 'Tanya Dorff': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bayer, Janssen Oncology, Exelixis, AstraZeneca, Sanofi/Aventis', 'Research Funding: Pfizer (Inst)'], 'Leonard Appleman': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AADi', 'Research Funding: Pfizer (Inst), Exelixis (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Astellas Pharma (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Bayer (Inst), Merck (Inst), Genentech/Roche (Inst), Aveo (Inst), Peloton Therapeutics (Inst), Calithera Biosciences (Inst), Seagen (Inst), Inovio Pharmaceuticals (Inst), Eisai (Inst), Lilly (Inst), Amgen (Inst), Surface Oncology (Inst), BioNTech (Inst), Epizyme (Inst), Janssen Oncology (Inst), Ipsen (Inst), Arvinas (Inst)', 'Other Relationship: Pfizer', 'Uncompensated Relationships: Exelixis'], 'Akash Patnaik': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Gilead Sciences, Merck, Infinity Pharmaceuticals', 'Honoraria: Prime Oncology, Medscape', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Exelixis, Guidepoint Pharmacy, Gerson Lehrman Group, Curio Science', 'Research Funding: Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Progenics (Inst), Clovis Oncology (Inst), Laekna Health Care (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Xencor (Inst), Zenith Pharmaceuticals (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bristol Myers Squibb, Prime Oncology, Exelixis'], 'Alan Bryce': ['Honoraria: Astellas Pharma, Bayer, Pfizer, Verity Pharmaceuticals, Myovant Sciences, Research to Practice, AstraZeneca, Advanced Accelerator Applications/Novartis, Castle Biosciences, Horizon CME, Janssen, Novartis, Janssen Oncology, Lilly', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Astellas Pharma', 'Research Funding: Janssen Oncology (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Clovis Oncology (Inst), Phosplatin Therapeutics (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Bayer, Pfizer'], 'James Mohler': ['Honoraria: NCCN-Pfizer-Myovant', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Mohler JL, Fiandalo M, Watt D, Sviripa V.

Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is a trophoblast cell surface antigen-2–directed antibody-drug conjugate with US Food and Drug Administration–accelerated approval to treat patients with locally advanced or mUC who previously received platinum-based chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI). Here, we report the primary analysis of TROPHY-U-01 cohort 3.

Methods: TROPHY-U-01 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03547973) is a multicohort, open-label phase II study. Patients were CPI-naïve and had mUC progression after platinum-based chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or ≤12 months in the (neo)adjuvant setting. Patients received 10 mg/kg of SG once on days 1 and 8 and 200 mg of pembrolizumab once on day 1 of 21-day cycles. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per central review. Secondary end points included clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of response (DOR) and progression-free survival (PFS) per central review, and safety.

Results: Cohort 3 included 41 patients (median age 67 years; 83% male; 78% visceral metastases [29% liver]). With a median follow-up of 14.8 months, the ORR was 41% (95% CI, 26.3 to 57.9; 20% complete response rate), CBR was 46% (95% CI, 30.7 to 62.6), median DOR was 11.1 months (95% CI, 4.8 to not estimable [NE]), and median PFS was 5.3 months (95% CI, 3.4 to 10.2). The median overall survival was 12.7 months (range, 10.7-NE). Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 61% of patients; most common were neutropenia (37%), leukopenia (20%), and diarrhea (20%).

Conclusion: SG plus pembrolizumab demonstrated a high response rate with an overall manageable toxicity profile in patients with mUC who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy. No new safety signals were detected.

Silk,MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; ME; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA; MA,"Purpose: Cemiplimab is approved for treating locally advanced or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). Solid organ transplant recipients have been excluded from immunotherapy trials, given concern for allograft rejection despite their increased risk of skin cancers. Chronic immunosuppression is necessary to prevent organ rejection but may attenuate antitumor response with PD-1 inhibitors.

Methods: We report a phase I study of cemiplimab for kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with advanced CSCC. After cross-taper to a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor and pulsed dose corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg once daily, the day before and on days 1-3 of each cycle, followed by 20 mg once daily on days 4-6, then 10 mg once daily until the day before each subsequent cycle), patients received cemiplimab 350 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for up to 2 years and were assessed for response every 8 weeks. The primary end point was the rate of kidney rejection, with key secondary end points including rate and duration of response, and survival.

Results: Twelve patients were treated. No kidney rejection or loss was observed. A response to cemiplimab was observed in five of 11 evaluable patients (46%; 90% CI, 22 to 73), including two with durable responses beyond a year. Median follow-up was 6.8 months (range, 0.7-29.8). Treatment-related grade 3 or greater adverse events occurred in five patients (42%), including diarrhea, infection, and metabolic disturbances. One patient died of angioedema and anaphylaxis attributed to mTOR inhibitor cross-taper.

Conclusion: mTOR inhibitor and corticosteroids represent a favorable immunosuppressive regimen for KTRs with advanced CSCC receiving immunotherapy. This combination resulted in durable antitumor responses with no kidney rejection events (funded by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04339062]).",3/20/2024,JCO.23.01498,{}
Nivolumab Plus Chemotherapy in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor–Mutated Metastatic Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer After Disease Progression on Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors: Final Results of CheckMate 722,Tony  Mok; Kazuhiko  Nakagawa; Keunchil  Park; Yuichiro  Ohe; Nicolas  Girard; Hye Ryun  Kim; Yi-Long  Wu; Justin  Gainor; Se-Hoon  Lee; Chao-Hua  Chiu; Sang-We  Kim; Cheng-Ta  Yang; Chien Liang  Wu; Lin  Wu; Meng-Chih  Lin; Jens  Samol; Kazuya  Ichikado; Mengzhao  Wang; Xiaoqing  Zhang; Judi  Sylvester; Sunney  Li; Ann  Forslund; James Chih-Hsin  Yang,China; Japan; Korea; TX; Japan; France; Korea; China; MA; Korea; Taiwan; Taiwan; Korea; Taiwan; Taiwan; China; Taiwan; Singapore; MD; Japan; China; NJ; NJ; NJ; NJ; Taiwan,"Purpose: The phase III CheckMate 722 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02864251) evaluated nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–mutated metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after disease progression on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

Methods: Patients with disease progression after first- or second-generation EGFR TKI therapy (without EGFR T790M mutation) or osimertinib (with/without T790M mutation) were randomly assigned 1:1 to nivolumab (360 mg once every 3 weeks) plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy (once every 3 weeks) or platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone (once every 3 weeks) for four cycles. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included 9- and 12-month PFS rates, overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR).

Results: Overall, 294 patients were randomly assigned. At final analysis (median follow-up, 38.1 months), PFS was not significantly improved with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy (median, 5.6 v 5.4 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.56 to 1.00]; P = .0528), with 9- and 12-month PFS rates of 25.9% versus 19.8%, and 21.2% versus 15.9%, respectively. Post hoc PFS subgroup analyses showed a trend favoring nivolumab plus chemotherapy in patients with tumors harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.97]), one line of previous EGFR TKI (0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.97]), or both (0.64 [95% CI, 0.47 to 0.88]). Median OS was 19.4 months with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus 15.9 months with chemotherapy, while ORR was 31.3% versus 26.7%, and median DOR was 6.7 versus 5.6 months, respectively. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 44.7% and 29.4% of patients treated with nivolumab plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone, respectively.

Conclusion: Nivolumab plus chemotherapy did not significantly improve PFS versus chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated metastatic NSCLC previously treated with EGFR TKIs.

Since hypoxic tumors are radioresistant, we posited that the aerobic state of a tumor could identify patients eligible for de-escalation of chemoradiotherapy while maintaining treatment efficacy.

Methods: We enrolled patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinoma to receive de-escalated definitive chemoradiotherapy in a phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03323463). Patients first underwent surgical removal of disease at their primary site, but not of gross disease in the neck. A baseline 18F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography scan was used to measure tumor hypoxia and was repeated 1-2 weeks intratreatment. Patients with nonhypoxic tumors received 30 Gy (3 weeks) with chemotherapy, whereas those with hypoxic tumors received standard chemoradiotherapy to 70 Gy (7 weeks). The primary objective was achieving a 2-year locoregional control (LRC) of 95% with a 7% noninferiority margin.

Results: One hundred fifty-eight patients with T0-2/N1-N2c were enrolled, of which 152 patients were eligible for analyses. Of these, 128 patients met criteria for 30 Gy and 24 patients received 70 Gy. The 2-year LRC was 94.7% (95% CI, 89.8 to 97.7), meeting our primary objective. With a median follow-up time of 38.3 (range, 22.1-58.4) months, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 94% and 100%, respectively, for the 30-Gy cohort. The 70-Gy cohort had similar 2-year PFS and OS rates at 96% and 96%, respectively. Acute grade 3-4 adverse events were more common in 70 Gy versus 30 Gy (58.3% v 32%; P = .02). Late grade 3-4 adverse events only occurred in the 70-Gy cohort, in which 4.5% complained of late dysphagia.

Conclusion: Tumor hypoxia is a promising approach to direct dosing of curative-intent chemoradiotherapy for HPV-related carcinomas with preserved efficacy and substantially reduced toxicity that requires further investigation.",3/10/2024,JCO.23.01308,{}

Methods: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed mPDAC were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive GEMPAX (paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 + gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2; IV; once at day (D) 1, D8, and D15/arm A) or gemcitabine (arm B) alone once at D1, D8, and D15 every 28 days until progression, toxicity, or patient's decision. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), quality of life, and safety.

Results: Overall, 211 patients (median age, 64 [30-86] years; 62% male) were included. After a median study follow-up for alive patients of 13.4 versus 13.8 months in arm A versus arm B, the median OS (95% CI) was 6.4 (5.2 to 7.4) versus 5.9 months (4.6 to 6.9; hazard ratio [HR], 0.87 [0.63 to 1.20]; P = 0.4095), the median PFS was 3.1 (2.2 to 4.3) versus 2.0 months (1.9 to 2.3; HR, 0.64 [0.47 to 0.89]; P = 0.0067), and the ORR was 17.1% (11.3 to 24.4) versus 4.2% (0.9 to 11.9; P = 0.008) in arm A versus arm B, respectively. Overall, 16.7% of patients in arm A and 2.9% in arm B discontinued their treatment because of adverse events (AEs). One grade 5 AE associated with both gemcitabine and paclitaxel was reported in arm A (acute respiratory distress), and 58.0% versus 27.1% of patients experienced grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs in arm A versus arm B, among which 15.2% versus 4.3% had anemia, 15.9% versus 15.7% had neutropenia, 19.6% versus 4.3% had thrombocytopenia, 10.1% versus 2.9% had asthenia and 12.3% versus 0.0% had neuropathy.

The results of the trial demonstrated the superiority of S in all STS histologies except for high-grade myxoid liposarcoma (HG-MLPS) where S and HT appeared to be equivalent. To further evaluate the noninferiority of HT compared with S, the HG-MLPS cohort was expanded.

Patients and Methods: Patients had localized high-grade (cellular component >5%; size ≥5 cm; deeply seated) MLPS of extremities or trunk wall. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). The secondary end point was overall survival (OS). The trial used a noninferiority Bayesian design, wherein HT would be considered not inferior to S if the posterior probability of the true hazard ratio (HR) being >1.25 was <5%.

Results: From May 2011 to June 2020, 101 patients with HG-MLPS were randomly assigned, 45 to the HT arm and 56 to the S arm. The median follow-up was 66 months (IQR, 37-89). Median size was 107 mm (IQR, 84-143), 106 mm (IQR, 75-135) in the HT arm and 108 mm (IQR, 86-150) in the S arm. At 60 months, the DFS and OS probabilities were 0.86 and 0.73 (HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.24 to 1.46]; log-rank P = .26 for DFS) and 0.88 and 0.90 (HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.37 to 3.93]; log-rank P = .77 for OS) in the HT and S arms, respectively. The posterior probability of HR being >1.25 for DFS met the Bayesian monitoring cutoff of <5% (4.93%). This result confirmed the noninferiority of trabectedin to AI suggested in the original study cohort.

Conclusion: Trabectedin may be an alternative to standard AI in HG-MLPS of the extremities or trunk when neoadjuvant treatment is a consideration.",3/10/2024,JCO.23.00908,{}

Patients and Methods: One thousand thirty-three patients were randomly assigned to intensified (fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and idarubicin [FLAG-Ida]) or standard (daunorubicin and Ara-C [DA]) induction chemotherapy, with one or two doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO). The primary end point was overall survival (OS).

Results: There was no difference in remission rate after two courses between FLAG-Ida + GO and DA + GO (complete remission [CR] + CR with incomplete hematologic recovery 93% v 91%) or in day 60 mortality (4.3% v 4.6%). There was no difference in OS (66% v 63%; P = .41); however, the risk of relapse was lower with FLAG-Ida + GO (24% v 41%; P < .001) and 3-year event-free survival was higher (57% v 45%; P < .001). In patients with an NPM1 mutation (30%), 3-year OS was significantly higher with FLAG-Ida + GO (82% v 64%; P = .005). NPM1 measurable residual disease (MRD) clearance was also greater, with 88% versus 77% becoming MRD-negative in peripheral blood after cycle 2 (P = .02). Three-year OS was also higher in patients with a FLT3 mutation (64% v 54%; P = .047). Fewer transplants were performed in patients receiving FLAG-Ida + GO (238 v 278; P = .02). There was no difference in outcome according to the number of GO doses, although NPM1 MRD clearance was higher with two doses in the DA arm. Patients with core binding factor AML treated with DA and one dose of GO had a 3-year OS of 96% with no survival benefit from FLAG-Ida + GO.

Conclusion: Overall, FLAG-Ida + GO significantly reduced relapse without improving OS. However, exploratory analyses show that patients with NPM1 and FLT3 mutations had substantial improvements in OS. By contrast, in patients with core binding factor AML, outcomes were excellent with DA + GO with no FLAG-Ida benefit.",4/1/2024,JCO.23.00943,"{'Nigel H.

We describe the impact of first-line (1L) enfortumab vedotin (EV) alone or with pembrolizumab (P) on QOL/functioning/symptoms in patients with la/mUC who were cisplatin-ineligible from EV-103 Cohort K.

Methods: In this phase Ib/II trial, patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to EV + P or EV monotherapy (mono). Exploratory patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire–Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) at baseline, once per week for cycles 1-3, and then in every cycle through the end of treatment. Changes in scores from baseline to week 24, reported as least squares mean (standard error), were assessed by mixed models for repeated measures. There were no formal statistical comparisons between treatment arms.

Results: Of 149 patients treated, 65 (EV + P) and 63 (EV mono) comprised the PRO analysis set. For EV + P, EORTC QLQ-C30 QOL was maintained through week 24 with improvements in emotional functioning, pain, and insomnia. Clinically meaningful improvements were seen in EORTC QLQ-C30 pain after EV + P at weeks 12 (–14.41 [3.14]) and 24 (–14.99 [3.56]) and BPI-SF worst pain at week 24 (–2.07 [0.37]). For EV mono, EORTC QLQ-C30 QOL remained stable with clinically meaningful improvements in EORTC QLQ-C30 pain (–12.55 [4.27]), insomnia (–14.46 [4.69]), and constipation (–10.09 [4.35]) at week 24. There were small-to-moderate improvements in BPI-SF worst pain at week 24.

Conclusion: EV + P in patients with la/mUC who were cisplatin-ineligible was associated with preservation or improvement of QOL/functioning/symptoms. Improvement in pain was seen in both PRO instruments and treatment arms. These data complement clinical outcomes of 1L EV + P.",4/20/2024,JCO.23.01547,"{'Matthew I.

Streptococcus salivarius K12 Alleviates Oral Mucositis in Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy for Malignant Head and Neck Tumors: A Randomized Controlled Trial,Xingchen  Peng; Zixia  Li; Yiyan  Pei; Shuhao  Zheng; Jinchi  Liu; Jingjing  Wang; Ruidan  Li; Xin  Xu,China; China; China; China; China; China; China; China,"Purpose: Oral mucositis (OM) is a common debilitating toxicity associated with radiotherapy (RT) for malignant head and neck tumors. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Streptococcus salivarius K12 (SsK12) in reducing the incidence, duration, and severity of severe OM (SOM).

Methods: A total of 160 patients with malignant head and neck tumors undergoing definitive or postoperative adjuvant RT were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive SsK12 probiotic (n = 80) or placebo (n = 80) at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. Patients were instructed to suck SsK12 or placebo lozenges thrice daily from the initiation to the end of RT. OM was evaluated twice a week during RT and once a week thereafter for up to 8 weeks. The primary end point was the incidence of SOM. Adverse events were assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0.

Results: Baseline patient characteristics were similar in the SsK12 and placebo groups. The incidence of SOM was significantly lower in the SsK12 group as compared with the placebo group (36.6% v 54.2%; P = .0351). The duration (median, 0.0 days v 7.0 days; mean, 8.9 days v 18.3 days; P = .0084) and time to develop SOM (median, not estimable v 42.0 days; hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.89]; log-rank test: P = .0123) were also improved in the case of the SsK12 group. Adverse events were similar between the groups, and mild or moderate gastrointestinal reactions (flatulence or dyspepsia) associated with the lozenges were observed in two patients in the SsK12 group. High-throughput sequencing results indicated that SsK12 inhibited opportunistic pathogens and enriched oral commensals during RT.

Conclusion: In this prospective, randomized clinical trial, SsK12 probiotic significantly reduced the incidence, onset, and duration of SOM with a good safety profile.",4/20/2024,JCO.23.00837,{}

The BEACON Neuroblastoma trial (EudraCT 2012-000072-42) evaluated three backbone chemotherapy regimens and the addition of the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab (B).

Materials and Methods: Patients age 1-21 years with RR-HRNB with adequate organ function and performance status were randomly assigned in a 3 × 2 factorial design to temozolomide (T), irinotecan-temozolomide (IT), or topotecan-temozolomide (TTo) with or without B. The primary end point was best overall response (complete or partial) rate (ORR) during the first six courses, by RECIST or International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria for patients with measurable or evaluable disease, respectively. Safety, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) time were secondary end points.

Results: One hundred sixty patients with RR-HRNB were included. For B random assignment (n = 160), the ORR was 26% (95% CI, 17 to 37) with B and 18% (95% CI, 10 to 28) without B (risk ratio [RR], 1.52 [95% CI, 0.83 to 2.77]; P = .17). Adjusted hazard ratio for PFS and OS were 0.89 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.27) and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.45), respectively. For irinotecan ([I]; n = 121) and topotecan (n = 60) random assignments, RRs for ORR were 0.94 and 1.22, respectively. A potential interaction between I and B was identified. For patients in the bevacizumab-irinotecan-temozolomide (BIT) arm, the ORR was 23% (95% CI, 10 to 42), and the 1-year PFS estimate was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.80).

Conclusion: The addition of B met protocol-defined success criteria for ORR and appeared to improve PFS. Within this phase II trial, BIT showed signals of antitumor activity with acceptable tolerability. Future trials will confirm these results in the chemoimmunotherapy era.",4/1/2024,JCO.23.00458,{}

A de-escalation strategy with anti-EGFR monotherapy represents a potential option to maintain efficacy while reducing cytotoxicity.

Methods: In this multicenter, open-label, phase III trial, patients with untreated RAS/BRAF wt mCRC were randomly assigned to receive either fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan/cetuximab (FOLFIRI/Cet) until disease progression (arm A) or FOLFIRI/Cet for eight cycles followed by Cet alone (arm B). The coprimary end points were a noninferior progression-free survival (PFS) in the modified per-protocol (mPP) population (>eight cycles) and a lower incidence of grade (G) 3-4 adverse events (AEs) for arm B compared with arm A.

Results: Overall, 606 patients were randomly assigned, with 300 assigned to arm A and 306 to arm B. The median follow-up was 22.3 months. In the mPP population, 291 events occurred with a PFS of 10 versus 12.2 months for arms B and A, respectively (P of noninferiority = .43). In the intention-to-treatment (ITT, ≥one cycle) population, 503 events occurred with a PFS of 9 versus 10.7 months (P = .39). The overall survival was 35.7 versus 30.7 months (P = .119) and 31.0 versus 25.2 months (P = .32) in the mPP and ITT population, respectively. Arm B had lower G3-4 AEs during the maintenance period than arm A (20.2% v 35.1%).

Conclusion: The ERMES study did not demonstrate noninferiority of maintenance with Cet alone. Despite a more favorable safety profile, maintenance with single-agent Cet after induction with FOLFIRI/Cet cannot be recommended for all patients but could represent an option in selected cases.",4/10/2024,JCO.23.01021,"{'Armando Orlandi': ['Honoraria: Novartis, Lilly, Pfizer, Gilead Sciences, Daiichi Sankyo/Astra Zeneca', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Pfizer, Novartis, Lilly, Daiichi Sankyo/Astra Zeneca', 'Research Funding: Merck KGaA', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer, Novartis, Gilead Sciences, Roche, Daiichi Sankyo/Astra Zeneca'], 'Nicola Normanno': ['Honoraria: Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lilly, MSD, Illumina, Merck Serono, Incyte, Biocartis, AstraZeneca, MSD', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Biocartis, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Incyte, Novartis, Roche', 'Research Funding: AstraZeneca (Inst), Biocartis (Inst), Illumina (Inst), Incyte (Inst), Merck Serono (Inst), Qiagen (Inst), Roche (Inst), Thermo Fisher Scientific (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Merck Serono'], 'Maria A.

Results: There was a statistically significant improvement in rPFS for olaparib plus abiraterone versus placebo plus abiraterone, with a median rPFS of 25 versus 17 months and a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.81) in the intention-to-treat population. In an exploratory analysis of the subgroup of 85 patients with BRCAm mCRPC, the HR for rPFS was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.45) and the HR for overall survival (OS) was 0.30 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.59). In an exploratory analysis of the subgroup of 711 patients without an identified BRCA mutation, the HR for rPFS was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.96) and the HR for OS was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.14). Adding olaparib to abiraterone resulted in increased toxicity, including anemia requiring transfusion in 18% of patients.

Conclusion: In patients with mCRPC, efficacy of the combination of olaparib plus abiraterone was primarily attributed to the treatment effect in the BRCAm subgroup, the indicated population for the approval. For patients without BRCAm, the FDA determined that the modest rPFS improvement, combined with clinically significant toxicities, did not demonstrate a favorable risk/benefit assessment.",2/10/2024,JCO.23.01868,"{'Erik Bloomquist': ['Employment: MSD.

Improvements in Survival and Clinical Benefit With Gemcitabine as First-Line Therapy for Patients With Advanced Pancreas Cancer: A Randomized Trial,H A  Burris3rd; M J  Moore; J  Andersen; M R  Green; M L  Rothenberg; M R  Modiano; M C  Cripps; R K  Portenoy; A M  Storniolo; P  Tarassoff; R  Nelson; F A  Dorr; C D  Stephens; D D  Von Hoff,USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.; USA.,"Purpose: Most patients with advanced pancreas cancer experience pain and must limit their daily activities because of tumor-related symptoms. To date, no treatment has had a significant impact on the disease. In early studies with gemcitabine, patients with pancreas cancer experienced an improvement in disease-related symptoms. Based on those findings, a definitive trial was performed to assess the effectiveness of gemcitabine in patients with newly diagnosed advanced pancreas cancer.

Patients and Methods: One hundred twenty-six patients with advanced symptomatic pancreas cancer completed a lead-in period to characterize and stabilize pain and were randomized to receive either gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 weekly x 7 followed by 1 week of rest, then weekly x 3 every 4 weeks thereafter (63 patients), or to fluorouracil (5-FU) 600 mg/m2 once weekly (63 patients). The primary efficacy measure was clinical benefit response, which was a composite of measurements of pain (analgesic consumption and pain intensity), Karnofsky performance status, and weight. Clinical benefit required a sustained (> or = 4 weeks) improvement in at least one parameter without worsening in any others. Other measures of efficacy included response rate, time to progressive disease, and survival.

Results: Clinical benefit response was experienced by 23.8% of gemcitabine-treated patients compared with 4.8% of 5-FU-treated patients (P = .0022). The median survival durations were 5.65 and 4.41 months for gemcitabine-treated and 5-FU-treated patients, respectively (P = .0025). The survival rate at 12 months was 18% for gemcitabine patients and 2% for 5-FU patients. Treatment was well tolerated.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that gemcitabine is more effective than 5-FU in alleviation of some disease-related symptoms in patients with advanced, symptomatic pancreas cancer. Gemcitabine also confers a modest survival advantage over treatment with 5-FU.",12/20/2023,JCO.22.02777,{}
Minimal Residual Disease Status Predicts Outcome in Patients With Previously Untreated Follicular Lymphoma: A Prospective Analysis of the Phase III GALLIUM Study,Christiane  Pott; Vindi  Jurinovic; Judith  Trotman; Britta  Kehden; Michael  Unterhalt; Michael  Herold; Richard van der  Jagt; Ann  Janssens; Michael  Kneba; Jiri  Mayer; Moya  Young; Christian  Schmidt; Andrea  Knapp; Tina  Nielsen; Helen  Brown; Nathalie  Spielewoy; Chris  Harbron; Alessia  Bottos; Kirsten  Mundt; Robert  Marcus; Wolfgang  Hiddemann; Eva  Hoster,Germany; Germany; Germany; Australia; Germany; Germany; Germany; Canada; Belgium; Germany; Czech Republic; United Kingdom; Germany; Switzerland; Switzerland; United Kingdom; Switzerland; United Kingdom; Switzerland; Switzerland; United Kingdom; Germany; Germany; Germany,"Purpose: We report an analysis of minimal residual/detectable disease (MRD) as a predictor of outcome in previously untreated patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) from the randomized, multicenter GALLIUM (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01332968) trial.

Patients and Methods: Patients received induction with obinutuzumab (G) or rituximab (R) plus bendamustine, or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy, followed by maintenance with the same antibody in responders. MRD status was assessed at predefined time points (mid-induction [MI], end of induction [EOI], and at 4-6 monthly intervals during maintenance and follow-up). Patients with evaluable biomarker data at diagnosis were included in the survival analysis.

Results: MRD positivity was associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) at MI (hazard ratio [HR], 3.03 [95% CI, 2.07 to 4.45]; P < .0001) and EOI (HR, 2.25 [95% CI, 1.53 to 3.32]; P < .0001). MRD response was higher after G- versus R-chemotherapy at MI (94.2% v 88.9%; P = .013) and at EOI (93.1% v 86.7%; P = .0077). Late responders (MI-positive/EOI-negative) had a significantly poorer PFS than early responders (MI-negative/EOI-negative; HR, 3.11 [95% CI, 1.75 to 5.52]; P = .00011). The smallest proportion of MRD positivity was observed in patients receiving bendamustine at MI (4.8% v 16.0% in those receiving CHOP; P < .0001). G appeared to compensate for less effective chemotherapy regimens, with similar MRD response rates observed across the G-chemo groups. During the maintenance period, more patients treated with R than with G were MRD-positive (R-CHOP, 20.7% v G-CHOP, 7.0%; R-CVP, 21.7% v G-CVP, 9.4%). Throughout maintenance, MRD positivity was associated with clinical relapse.

Conclusion: MRD status can determine outcome after induction and during maintenance, and MRD negativity is a prerequisite for long-term disease control in FL. The higher MRD responses after G- versus R-based treatment confirm more effective tumor cell clearance.",2/10/2024,JCO.23.00838,"{'Christiane Pott': ['Honoraria: Roche Pharma AG', ""Speakers' Bureau: Roche Pharma AG"", 'Research Funding: Roche/Genentech'], 'Judith Trotman': ['Research Funding: Beigene (Inst), Roche/Genentech (Inst), Pharmacyclics (Inst), Janssen-Cilag (Inst), Takeda (Inst), BMS (Inst), Cellectar (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche/Genentech'], 'Michael Unterhalt': ['Uncompensated Relationships: Roche (Inst), Janssen Cilag GmbH (Inst), Roche Pharma AG (Inst), Bayer (Inst), Roche Pharma AG (Inst)'], 'Richard van der Jagt': ['Employment: No relationships to disclose', ""Speakers' Bureau: Teva, Lundbeck, Gilead, Roche"", 'Research Funding: Teva, Gilead, Roche (Inst)'], 'Ann Janssens': ['Honoraria: AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, BeiGene, Janssen, Incyte, Novartis, Sobi, Sanofi, Takeda', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AbbVie, AstraZeneca, BeiGene, Janssen, Incyte, Gilead Sciences, MSD Oncology, Novartis, Sob, Sandoz-Novartis, Sanofi, Roche, Takeda', 'Research Funding: Janssen (Inst)'], 'Michael Kneba': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Novartis, BionTec, Moderna'], 'Jiri Mayer': ['Research Funding: BeiGene, Roche'], 'Moya Young': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: AstraZeneca'], 'Christian Schmidt': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Roche/Genentech', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Kite/Gilead, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, Janssen', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Kite/Gilead, BeiGene, Janssen'], 'Andrea Knapp': ['Employment: Roche'], 'Tina Nielsen': ['Employment: Roche', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Roche'], 'Helen Brown': ['Employment: Parexel International, Roche'], 'Nathalie Spielewoy': ['Employment: Roche', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Roche'], 'Chris Harbron': ['Employment: Roche', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Roche, AstraZeneca'], 'Alessia Bottos': ['Employment: Roche', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Roche'], 'Kirsten Mundt': ['Employment: Roche/Genentech, Novartis', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Roche/Genentech'], 'Wolfgang Hiddemann': ['Research Funding: Roche (Inst)']}"

Methods: Patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) MCL after ≥two lines of previous therapy, including a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), an alkylating agent, and a CD20-targeted agent, received lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) at a target dose level (DL) of 50 × 106 (DL1) or 100 × 106 (DL2) chimeric antigen receptor-positive T cells. Primary end points were adverse events (AEs), dose-limiting toxicities, and objective response rate (ORR) by independent review committee per Lugano criteria.

Results: Of 104 leukapheresed patients, liso-cel was infused into 88. Median (range) number of previous lines of therapy was three (1-11) with 30% receiving ≥five previous lines of therapy, 73% of patients were age 65 years and older, 69% had refractory disease, 53% had BTKi refractory disease, 23% had TP53 mutation, and 8% had secondary CNS lymphoma. Median (range) on-study follow-up was 16.1 months (0.4-60.5). In the efficacy set (n = 83; DL1 + DL2), ORR was 83.1% (95% CI, 73.3 to 90.5) and complete response (CR) rate was 72.3% (95% CI, 61.4 to 81.6). Median duration of response was 15.7 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 24.0) and progression-free survival was 15.3 months (95% CI, 6.6 to 24.9). Most common grade ≥3 treatment-emergent AEs were neutropenia (56%), anemia (37.5%), and thrombocytopenia (25%). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was reported in 61% of patients (grade 3/4, 1%; grade 5, 0), neurologic events (NEs) in 31% (grade 3/4, 9%; grade 5, 0), grade ≥3 infections in 15%, and prolonged cytopenia in 40%.

Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to osimertinib plus platinum-pemetrexed (combination) or osimertinib monotherapy until disease progression or discontinuation. Brain scans were performed in all patients at baseline and progression and at scheduled assessments until progression for patients with baseline CNS metastases; scans were assessed by neuroradiologist CNS blinded independent central review (BICR).

Results: On the basis of baseline CNS BICR, 118 of 279 (combination) and 104 of 278 (monotherapy) randomly assigned patients had ≥one measurable and/or nonmeasurable CNS lesion and were included in the CNS full analysis set (cFAS); 40 of 118 and 38 of 104 had ≥one measurable target CNS lesion and were included in the post hoc CNS evaluable-for-response set (cEFR). In the cFAS, the hazard ratio (HR) for CNS progression or death was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.33 to 1.01). In patients without baseline CNS metastases, the HR for CNS progression or death was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.43 to 1.04). In the cFAS, CNS objective response rates (ORRs; 95% CI) were 73% (combination; 64 to 81) versus 69% (monotherapy; 59 to 78); 59% versus 43% had CNS complete response (CR). In the cEFR, CNS ORRs (95% CI) were 88% (73 to 96) versus 87% (72 to 96); 48% versus 16% had CNS CR.

Conclusion: Osimertinib plus platinum-pemetrexed demonstrated improved CNS efficacy compared with osimertinib monotherapy, including delaying CNS progression, irrespective of baseline CNS metastasis status.

Canakinumab, a human, monoclonal anti–interleukin (IL)-1β antibody, has potential to enhance the activity of PD-L1 inhibitors and chemotherapy (CT) by inhibiting protumor inflammation.

Methods: CANOPY-1 was a phase III, randomized, double-blind study comparing canakinumab (200 mg subcutaneously once every 3 weeks) versus placebo, both combined with pembrolizumab (200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks) and platinum-based doublet CT, as first-line treatment for advanced/metastatic NSCLC without EGFR or ALK mutations. The primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints included overall response rate, safety, and patient-reported outcomes.

Results: Overall, 643 patients were randomly assigned to canakinumab (n = 320) or placebo (n = 323). With a median study follow-up of 6.5 months, the median PFS was 6.8 months with canakinumab versus 6.8 months with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.09; P = .102). With a median study follow-up of 21.2 months, the median OS was 20.8 months with canakinumab versus 20.2 months with placebo (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.10; P = .123). No unexpected safety signals were observed for canakinumab combination. Infection rates were comparable between treatment and control arms. A higher frequency of neutropenia and ALT increase (grade ≤2) were reported in the treatment arm. Higher baseline C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels were associated with shorter PFS and OS. Patients treated with canakinumab had clinically meaningful delays in deterioration of lung cancer symptoms, including chest pain and coughing per LC13 and dyspnea per LC13 and C30.

Conclusion: The addition of canakinumab to first-line pembrolizumab and CT did not prolong PFS or OS in patients with NSCLC.",1/10/2024,JCO.23.00980,"{'Daniel S.W.

Bosutinib has a different tolerability profile than other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and potentially less impact on growth (preclinical data). The primary objective of this first-in-child trial was to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for pediatric R/I and ND patients.

Patients and Methods: In the phase I part of this international, open-label trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04258943), children age 1-18 years with R/I (per European LeukemiaNet 2013) Ph+ CML were enrolled using a 6 + 4 design, testing 300, 350, and 400 mg/m2 once daily with food. The RP2D was the dose resulting in 0/6 or 1/10 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle and achieving adult target AUC levels for the respective indication. As ND participants were only enrolled in phase II, the ND RP2D was selected based on data from R/I patients.

Results: Thirty patients were enrolled; 27 were evaluable for DLT: six at 300 mg/m2, 11 at 350 mg/m2 (one DLT), and 10 at 400 mg/m2 (one DLT). The mean AUCs at 300 mg/m2, 350 mg/m2, and 400 mg/m2 were 2.20 μg h/mL, 2.52 μg h/mL, and 2.66 μg h/mL, respectively. The most common adverse event was diarrhea (93%; ≥grade 3: 11%). Seven patients stopped because of intolerance and eight because of insufficient response. Complete cytogenetic and major molecular response to bosutinib appeared comparable with other published phase I/II trials with second-generation TKIs in children.

Conclusion: Bosutinib was safe and effective. The pediatric RP2D was 400 mg/m2 once daily (max 600 mg/d) with food in R/I patients and 300 mg/m2 once daily (max 500 mg/d) with food in ND patients, which achieved targeted exposures as per adult experience.",3/1/2024,JCO.23.00897,{}
DNA Mutational Profiling in Patients With Colorectal Cancer Treated With Standard of Care Reveals Differences in Outcome and Racial Distribution of Mutations,Federico  Innocenti; Wancen  Mu; Xueping  Qu; Fang-Shu  Ou; Omar  Kabbarah; Charles David  Blanke; Alan P.  Venook; Heinz-Josef  Lenz; Naim U.

We aimed to discover novel mutated genes associated with prognosis and differential response to therapy with the biologics.

Methods: Primary tumor DNA from 548 patients was sequenced using FoundationOne. The effect of mutated genes and mutations on overall survival (OS) was tested adjusting for microsatellite instability status, BRAF V600E, all RAS mutations, arm, sex, and age.

Results: The median number (lower-upper quartile) of mutated genes was 5 (3-7), 5 (3-6) in microsatellite stable and 12.5 (4.5-32) in microsatellite instability-high tumors. Mutated KRAS and APC were more frequent in Black (53% and 85%) than White (27% and 65%, respectively) patients while BRAF V600E was less frequent in Black (5%) than White (14%) patients. The median OS in patients with BRAF non-V600E (2.2% of patients) was 31.9 months (95% CI, 15.1 to not applicable [NA]) similar to that of BRAF wild-type (WT) patients (31.2 months [95% CI, 29.0 to 33.9]). Mutated LRP1B (10.7% of patients) was associated with improved OS compared with WT LRP1B (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.80]). RNF43 (5.6% of patients) interacted with treatment arms as, in the cetuximab arm, patients with mutated RNF43 had a median OS of 11.5 (95% CI, 10.8 to NA) months compared with 30.1 (95% CI, 24.9 to 35.3) months in patients with WT RNF43, whereas in the bevacizumab arm, patients with mutated RNF43 had a median OS of 25.0 (95% CI, 14.2 to NA) months compared with 31.3 (95% CI, 29.0 to 34.3) months in patients with WT RNF43.

Conclusion: These results can provide new tools to predict patient outcome and improve therapeutic decisions and trial participation in patient minorities. The molecular alterations identified in this study may direct biomarker-driven studies.",2/1/2024,JCO.23.00825,{}

Patients and Methods: The data analyzed and reported are from two phase II, open-label, multicenter, single-arm studies (RC48-C005 and RC48-C009) in patients with HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry 3+ or 2+) locally advanced or metastatic UC who have progressed on at least one previous line of systemic chemotherapy. Patients received DV treatment (2 mg/kg IV infusion, once every 2 weeks). The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety were also assessed.

Results: One hundred and seven patients were enrolled in total. The overall confirmed ORR by BIRC was 50.5% (95% CI, 40.6 to 60.3). Consistent results were observed in prespecified subgroups including patients with liver metastasis and patients previously treated with anti–PD-1/L1 therapies. By the cutoff date of May 10, 2022, the median duration of response was 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.7 to 10.8). The median PFS and OS were 5.9 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 7.2) and 14.2 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 18.8), respectively. The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were peripheral sensory neuropathy (68.2%), leukopenia (50.5%), AST increased (42.1%), and neutropenia (42.1%). Fifty-eight (54.2%) patients experienced grade ≥3 TRAEs, including peripheral sensory neuropathy (18.7%) and neutropenia (12.1%).

Patients and Methods: Patients, age 3-21 years, with progressive/recurrent pLGG received everolimus orally, 5 mg/m2 once daily. Frequency of driver gene alterations was compared among independent pLGG cohorts of newly diagnosed and progressive/recurrent patients. PFS at 6 months (primary end point) and median PFS (secondary end point) were estimated for association with everolimus therapy.

Results: Between 2012 and 2019, 65 subjects with progressive/recurrent pLGG (median age, 9.6 years; range, 3.0-19.9; 46% female) were enrolled, with a median follow-up of 57.5 months. The 6-month PFS was 67.4% (95% CI, 60.0 to 80.0) and median PFS was 11.1 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 19.8). Hypertriglyceridemia was the most common grade ≥3 adverse event. PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation did not correlate with clinical outcomes (6-month PFS, active 68.4% v nonactive 63.3%; median PFS, active 11.2 months v nonactive 11.1 months; P = .80). Rare/novel KIAA1549::BRAF fusion breakpoints were most frequent in supratentorial midline pilocytic astrocytomas, in patients with progressive/recurrent disease, and correlated with poor clinical outcomes (median PFS, rare/novel KIAA1549::BRAF fusion breakpoints 6.1 months v common KIAA1549::BRAF fusion breakpoints 16.7 months; P < .05). Multivariate analysis confirmed their independent risk factor status for disease progression in PNOC001 and other, independent cohorts. Additionally, rare pathogenic germline variants in homologous recombination genes were identified in 6.8% of PNOC001 patients.

Conclusion: Everolimus is a well-tolerated therapy for progressive/recurrent pLGGs. Rare/novel KIAA1549::BRAF fusion breakpoints may define biomarkers for progressive disease and should be assessed in future clinical trials.",2/1/2024,JCO.23.01838,"{'Daphne A.

We report final progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) analyses.

Methods: Patients received tiragolumab 600 mg/placebo, plus atezolizumab 1,200 mg and CE (four cycles), then maintenance tiragolumab/placebo plus atezolizumab. Primary end points were investigator-assessed PFS and OS in patients without history/presence of brain metastases (primary analysis set [PAS]). Additional end points included PFS and OS in all patients regardless of brain metastases status (full analysis set [FAS]), response, and safety.

Results: Four hundred ninety patients were randomly assigned (FAS): 243 to tiragolumab arm and 247 to control arm. At the cutoff date (February 6, 2022; median duration of follow-up, 14.3 months [PAS] and 13.9 months [FAS]), final analysis of PFS in the PAS (n = 397) did not reach statistical significance (stratified hazard ratio [HR], 1.11; P = .3504; median, 5.4 months tiragolumab v 5.6 months control). At the cutoff date (September 6, 2022; median duration of follow-up, 21.2 months [FAS]), median OS in the PAS at final OS analysis was 13.1 months in both arms (stratified HR, 1.14; P = .2859). Median PFS and OS in the FAS were consistent with the PAS. The proportion of patients with immune-mediated adverse events (AEs) in the tiragolumab and control arms was 54.4% and 49.2%, respectively (grade 3/4: 7.9% and 7.7%). AEs leading to treatment withdrawal occurred in 8.4% and 9.3% of tiragolumab- and control-treated patients, respectively.

Conclusion: Tiragolumab did not provide additional benefit over atezolizumab and CE in untreated ES-SCLC.

This phase III study investigated the effect of combining oxaliplatin with LV5FU2, with progression-free survival as the primary end point.

Patients and Methods: Four hundred twenty previously untreated patients with measurable disease were randomized to receive a 2-hour infusion of LV (200 mg/m2/d) followed by a 5FU bolus (400 mg/m2/d) and 22-hour infusion (600 mg/m2/d) for 2 consecutive days every 2 weeks, either alone or together with oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion on day 1.

Results: Patients allocated to oxaliplatin plus LV5FU2 had significantly longer progression-free survival (median, 9.0 v 6.2 months; P = .0003) and better response rate (50.7% v 22.3%; P = .0001) when compared with the control arm. The improvement in overall survival did not reach significance (median, 16.2 v 14.7 months; P = .12). LV5FU2 plus oxaliplatin gave higher frequencies of National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria grade 3/4 neutropenia (41.7% v 5.3% of patients), grade 3/4 diarrhea (11.9% v 5.3%), and grade 3 neurosensory toxicity (18.2% v 0%), but this did not result in impairment of quality of life (QoL). Survival without disease progression or deterioration in global health status was longer in patients allocated to oxaliplatin treatment (P = .004).

Conclusion: The LV5FU2-oxaliplatin combination seems beneficial as first-line therapy in advanced colorectal cancer, demonstrating a prolonged progression-free survival with acceptable tolerability and maintenance of QoL.",11/20/2023,JCO.22.02773,{}

Methods: DANTE started as multicenter, randomized phase II trial, which was subsequently converted to a phase III trial. Here, we present the results of the phase II proportion, focusing on surgical pathology and safety outcomes on an exploratory basis. Patients with resectable EGA (≥cT2 or cN+) were assigned to either four preoperative and postoperative cycles of FLOT combined with ATZ, followed by eight cycles of ATZ maintenance (arm A) or FLOT alone (arm B).

Results: Two hundred ninety-five patients were randomly assigned (A, 146; B, 149) with balanced baseline characteristics between arms. Twenty-three patients (8%) had tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI), and 58% patients had tumors with a PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) of ≥1. Surgical morbidity (A, 45%; B, 42%) and 60-day mortality (A, 3%; B, 2%) were comparable between arms. Downstaging favored arm A versus arm B (ypT0, 23% v 15% [one-sided P = .044]; ypT0-T2, 61% v 48% [one-sided P = .015]; ypN0, 68% v 54% [one-sided P = .012]). Histopathologic complete regression rates (pathologic complete response or TRG1a) were higher after FLOT plus ATZ (A, 24%; B, 15%; one-sided P = .032), and the difference was more pronounced in the PD-L1 CPS ≥10 (A, 33%; B, 12%) and MSI (A, 63%; B, 27%) subpopulations. Complete margin-free (R0) resection rates were relatively high in both arms (A, 96%; B, 95%). The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in both groups.

Conclusion: Within the limitations of the exploratory nature of the data, the addition of ATZ to perioperative FLOT is safe and improved postoperative stage and histopathologic regression.",2/1/2024,JCO.23.00975,"{'Thorsten Oliver Götze': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Lilly, MSD Oncology, Bayer, Servier, Roche, Novartis, Incyte, Foundation Medicine, Bristol Myers Squibb', ""Speakers' Bureau: Lilly, MSD Oncology"", 'Research Funding: Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, Deutsche Krebshilfe (Inst), Lilly (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Incyte (Inst)'], 'Peter Thuss-Patience': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol-Meyers-Squibb, Merck Serono, Lilly, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Astellas Pharma, MSD, Servier', 'Research Funding: Merck/Pfizer (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Merck Serono'], 'Matthias Biebl': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Afferent Pharmaceuticals', 'Research Funding: Ethicon/Johnson & Johnson'], 'Nils Homann': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: MSD Oncology, BMS GmbH & Co.

We report exploratory post hoc analysis of the subgroup of patients with mCRPC with BRCA alterations in PROfound.

Methods: All patients had an alteration in a homologous recombination repair gene by tumor tissue testing, of which 160 had underlying BRCA alterations. rPFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Confirmed objective response rate and safety were also assessed.

Results: Olaparib was associated with longer rPFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.32]) and OS (HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.95]) than control. There was an rPFS benefit with olaparib in all zygosity subgroups (biallelic [n = 88]; HR, 0.08 [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.16], heterozygous [n = 15] and unknown [n = 57]; HR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.16 to 0.60]). Patients with BRCA2 homozygous deletions experienced prolonged responses to olaparib (n = 16; median rPFS, 16.6 months [95% CI, 9.3 to not reached]). Some evaluations are limited by small patient numbers. Germline DNA analysis was performed for 112 (70%) patients; risk of disease progression was similar for patients with germline (n = 61; HR, 0.08 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.18]) and somatic (n = 51; HR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.37]) BRCA alterations.

Conclusion: In all subgroups assessed, olaparib improved outcomes versus abiraterone or enzalutamide for patients with mCRPC with BRCA alterations whose disease had progressed on previous

We aimed to evaluate the clinical activity of gemcitabine-cisplatin (GC) plus anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab as initial treatment in HER2-positive BTCs.

Methods: This study was an investigator-initiated, open-label, single-arm, multi-institutional, phase II trial in adult patients with HER2-positive (defined as immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or IHC 2+ and fluorescent in situ hybridization–positive), treatment-naïve BTCs. The primary end point of the study was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). Next-generation sequencing was performed on tissue samples to evaluate mutational status.

Results: From March 2020 to August 2022, of the 876 screened patients, 118 (13.4%) were found to have HER2-positive status, of whom 90 were enrolled in the study. Most patients had GBC (n = 96; 96%) with two or more sites of metastatic disease (n = 70; 78%). With a median follow-up of 17.3 (95% CI, 15.22 to 19.32) months, 72 patients had disease progression with a median PFS of 7 (95% CI, 6.2 to 7.8) months. The diagnosis to event 6-month PFS rate was 75.6% (95% CI, 66.6 to 84.6). A complete or partial response was seen in 50 (55.5%) patients and 22 (24.4%) patients had stable disease as the best response to treatment, for an overall disease control rate of 80%. The presence of isolated TP53 mutations was associated with inferior PFS compared with other mutations (TERT promoter, HER2, PIK3CA, etc) or no detected mutations (6.51 v 12.02 v 10.58 months; P < .001).

Conclusion: The combination of GC and trastuzumab achieved its primary end point of improving PFS compared with historical data in the treatment-naïve HER2-positive BTC. Evaluating additional mutations such as TP53 and PIK3CA along with HER2 testing may help to preferentially select patients for anti-HER2 therapy in the future (Clinical Trial Registry India number: CTRI/2019/11/021955).",3/1/2024,JCO.23.01193,"{'Vikas Ostwal': [""Research Funding: Dr Reddy's Laboratories (Inst), Cadila Pharmaceuticals (Inst), Lupin Pharmaceuticals (Inst), Intas (Inst), BDR Pharmaceutics (Inst), Panacea Pharmaceuticals (Inst), NATCO Pharma (Inst)"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: AstraZeneca, NATCO Pharma'], 'Prabhat Bhargava': ['Honoraria: Merck (Inst), Intas (Inst)', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Lupin Pharmaceuticals (Inst), Mankind Pharma (Inst)', ""Speakers' Bureau: Novartis (Inst), Zydus Pharmaceuticals (Inst)""], 'Sujay Srinivas': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca'], 'Akhil Kapoor': ['Research Funding: AstraZeneca (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Lilly (Inst), Biocon (Inst), Bayer (Inst)']}"

Patients and Methods: One hundred sixty-seven patients were randomly assigned to receive bevacizumab 10 mg/kg alone or in combination with irinotecan 340 mg/m2 or 125 mg/m2 (with or without concomitant enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, respectively) once every 2 weeks. Primary end points were 6-month progression-free survival and objective response rate, as determined by independent radiology review. Secondary end points included safety and overall survival.

Results: In the bevacizumab-alone and the bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan groups, estimated 6-month progression-free survival rates were 42.6% and 50.3%, respectively; objective response rates were 28.2% and 37.8%, respectively; and median overall survival times were 9.2 months and 8.7 months, respectively. There was a trend for patients who were taking corticosteroids at baseline to take stable or decreasing doses over time. Of the patients treated with bevacizumab alone or bevacizumab plus irinotecan, 46.4% and 65.8%, respectively, experienced grade ≥ 3 adverse events, the most common of which were hypertension (8.3%) and convulsion (6.0%) in the bevacizumab-alone group and convulsion (13.9%), neutropenia (8.9%), and fatigue (8.9%) in the bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan group. Intracranial hemorrhage was noted in two patients (2.4%) in the bevacizumab-alone group (grade 1) and in three patients (3.8%) patients in the bevacizumab-plus-irinotecan group (grades 1, 2, and 4, respectively).

Conclusion: Bevacizumab, alone or in combination with irinotecan, was well tolerated and active in recurrent glioblastoma.",11/10/2023,JCO.22.02772,{}

We conducted a randomized phase II trial to evaluate whether administering IPI once every 12 weeks (modified), instead of once every 3 weeks (standard), in combination with NIVO, is associated with a favorable toxicity profile.

Methods: Treatment-naïve patients with clear-cell aRCC were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive four doses of modified or standard IPI, 1 mg/kg, in combination with NIVO (3 mg/kg). The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse event (trAE) among those who received at least one dose of therapy. The key secondary end point was 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) in the modified arm compared with historical sunitinib control. The study was not designed to formally compare arms for efficacy.

Results: Between March 2018 and January 2020, 192 patients (69.8% intermediate/poor-risk) were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study drug. The incidence of grade 3-5 trAEs was significantly lower among participants receiving modified versus standard IPI (32.8% v 53.1%; odds ratio, 0.43 [90% CI, 0.25 to 0.72]; P = .0075). The 12-month PFS (90% CI) using modified IPI was 46.1% (38.6 to 53.2). At a median follow-up of 21 months, the overall response rate was 45.3% versus 35.9% and the median PFS was 10.8 months versus 9.8 months in the modified and standard IPI groups, respectively.

Conclusion: Rates of grade 3-5 trAEs were significantly lower in patients receiving modified versus standard IPI. Although 12-month PFS did not meet the prespecified efficacy threshold compared with historical control, informal comparison of treatment groups did not suggest any reduction in efficacy with the modified schedule.",1/20/2024,JCO.23.00236,"{'Naveen S.

This dose-escalation study investigated the safety, efficacy, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for 225Ac-J591, anti-PSMA monoclonal antibody J591 radiolabeled with the alpha emitter actinium-225.

Methods: Following investigational new drug-enabling preclinical studies, we enrolled patients with progressive mCRPC that was refractory to or who refused standard treatment options (including androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and had received or been deemed ineligible for taxane chemotherapy). No selection for PSMA was performed. Patients received a single dose of 225Ac-J591 at one of seven dose-escalation levels followed by expansion at the highest dose. Primary end point of dose-escalation cohort was determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and RP2D.

Results: Radiochemistry and animal studies were favorable. Thirty-two patients received 225Ac-J591 in an accelerated dose-escalation design (22 in dose escalation, 10 in expansion). One patient (1 of 22; 4.5%) experienced DLT in cohort 6 (80 KBq/kg) but none in cohort 7; MTD was not reached, and RP2D was the highest dose level (93.3 KBq/kg). The majority of high-grade adverse events (AEs) were hematologic with an apparent relationship with administered radioactivity. Nonhematologic AEs were generally of low grade. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declines and circulating tumor cell (CTC) control were observed: 46.9% had at least 50% PSA decline at any time (34.4% confirmed PSA response), and protocol-defined CTC count response occurred in 13 of 22 (59.1%).

Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first-in-human phase I dose-escalation trial of a single dose of 225Ac-J591 in 32 patients with pretreated progressive mCRPC demonstrated safety and preliminary efficacy signals.

Methods: This placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03398655) randomly assigned patients with PROC 1:1 to receive intravenous ofra-vec every 8 weeks with once a week IV paclitaxel or placebo with paclitaxel until disease progression. The dual primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review.

Results: Between December 2017 and March 2022, 409 patients were randomly assigned. The median PFS was 5.29 months in the ofra-vec arm and 5.36 months in the control arm, hazard ratio (HR) 1.03 (CI, 0.83 to 1.29; P = .7823). The median OS with ofra-vec was 13.37 months versus 13.14 months, HR 0.97 (CI, 0.75 to 1.27; P = .8440). Objective response rates (ORRs) per RECIST 1.1 were similar in both arms: 28.9% with ofra-vec versus 29.6% with control. In both treatment arms, response to CA-125 was a substantial prognostic factor for both PFS and OS. In the ofra-vec arm, the HR in CA-125 responders compared with that in nonresponders for PFS was 0.2428 (CI, 0.1642 to 0.3588), and for OS, the HR was 0.3343 (CI, 0.2134 to 0.5238). Safety profile was characterized by common transient flu–like symptoms such as fever and chills.

Conclusion: The addition of ofra-vec to paclitaxel did not improve PFS or OS. The PFS and ORR in the control arm exceeded the results that were anticipated on the basis of the AURELIA chemotherapy control arm. CA-125 response was a substantial prognostic biomarker for PFS and OS in patients with PROC treated with paclitaxel.",1/10/2024,JCO.22.02915,"{'Rebecca C.

Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) are still being debated. This randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter phase III trial (EudraCT 2006-006088-22; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02158988) explored the impact on overall survival (OS) of HIPEC after CRS.

Patients and Methods: Adult patients with GC and histologically proven PM were randomly assigned (1:1) to perioperative chemotherapy and CRS alone (CRS-A) or CRS plus HIPEC (CRS + H). HIPEC comprised mitomycin C 15 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 in 5 L of saline perfused for 60 minutes at 42°C. The primary end point was OS; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), other distant metastasis-free survival (MFS), and safety. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle.

Results: Between March 2014 and June 2018, 105 patients were randomly assigned (53 patients to CRS-A and 52 patients to CRS + H). The trial stopped prematurely because of slow recruitment. In 55 patients, treatment stopped before CRS mainly due to disease progression/death. Median OS was the same for both groups (CRS + H, 14.9 [97.2% CI, 8.7 to 17.7] months v CRS-A, 14.9 [97.2% CI, 7.0 to 19.4] months; P = .1647). The PFS was 3.5 months (95% CI, 3.0 to 7.0) in the CRS-A group and 7.1 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 10.5; P = .047) in the CRS + H group. The CRS + H group showed better MFS (10.2 months [95% CI, 7.7 to 14.7] v CRS-A, 9.2 months [95% CI, 6.8 to 11.5]; P = .0286). The incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) was similar between groups (CRS-A, 38.1% v CRS + H, 43.6%; P = .79).

Conclusion: This study showed no OS difference between CRS + H and CRS-A. PFS and MFS were significantly better in the CRS + H group, which needs further exploration.

Fletcher,Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.; Switzerland.,"Purpose: Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) express constitutively activated mutant isoforms of KIT or kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) that are potential therapeutic targets for imatinib mesylate. The relationship between mutations in these kinases and clinical response to imatinib was examined in a group of patients with advanced GIST.

Patients and Methods: GISTs from 127 patients enrolled onto a phase II clinical study of imatinib were examined for mutations of KIT or PDGFRA. Mutation types were correlated with clinical outcome.

Results: Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA were found in 112 (88.2%) and six (4.7%) GISTs, respectively. Most KIT mutations involved exon 9 (n = 23) or exon 11 (n = 85). All KIT mutant isoforms, but only a subset of PDGFRA mutant isoforms, were sensitive to imatinib, in vitro. In patients with GISTs harboring exon 11 KIT mutations, the partial response rate (PR) was 83.5%, whereas patients with tumors containing an exon 9 KIT mutation or no detectable mutation of KIT or PDGFRA had PR rates of 47.8% (P = .0006) and 0.0% (P < .0001), respectively. Patients whose tumors contained exon 11 KIT mutations had a longer event-free and overall survival than those whose tumors expressed either exon 9 KIT mutations or had no detectable kinase mutation.

Conclusion: Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA are found in the vast majority of GISTs, and the mutational status of these oncoproteins is predictive of clinical response to imatinib. PDGFRA mutations can explain response and sensitivity to imatinib in some GISTs lacking KIT mutations.",11/1/2023,JCO.22.02771,{}

Saulnier Sholler,NC; MO; SC; SC; PA; KY; TX; TX; TX; HI; CT; CT; FL; PA; CA; CA; CA; CA; TX; MI; NJ; PA,"Purpose: Long-term survival in high-risk neuroblastoma (HRNB) is approximately 50%, with mortality primarily driven by relapse. Eflornithine (DFMO) to reduce risk of relapse after completion of immunotherapy was investigated previously in a single-arm, phase II study (NMTRC003B; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02395666) that suggested improved event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with historical rates in a phase III trial (Children Oncology Group ANBL0032; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00026312). Using patient-level data from ANBL0032 as an external control, we present new analyses to further evaluate DFMO as HRNB postimmunotherapy maintenance.

Patients and Methods: NMTRC003B (2012-2016) enrolled patients with HRNB (N = 141) after standard up-front or refractory/relapse treatment who received up to 2 years of continuous treatment with oral DFMO (750 ± 250 mg/m2 twice a day). ANBL0032 (2001-2015) enrolled patients with HRNB postconsolidation, 1,328 of whom were assigned to dinutuximab (ch.14.18) treatment. Selection rules identified 92 NMTRC003B patients who participated in (n = 87) or received up-front treatment consistent with (n = 5) ANBL0032 (the DFMO/treated group) and 852 patients from ANBL0032 who could have been eligible for NMTRC003B after immunotherapy, but did not enroll (the NO-DFMO/control group). The median follow-up time for DFMO/treated patients was 6.1 years (IQR, 5.2-7.2) versus 5.0 years (IQR, 3.5-7.0) for NO-DFMO/control patients. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression compared EFS and OS for overall groups, 3:1 (NO-DFMO:DFMO) propensity score–matched cohorts balanced on 11 baseline demographic and disease characteristics with exact matching on MYCN, and additional sensitivity analyses.

Results: DFMO after completion of immunotherapy was associated with improved EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50 [95% CI, 0.29 to 0.84]; P = .008) and OS (HR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.19 to 0.76]; P = .007). The results were confirmed with propensity score–matched cohorts and sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion: The externally controlled analyses presented show a relapse risk reduction in patients with HRNB treated with postimmunotherapy DFMO.",1/1/2024,JCO.22.02875,{}

We evaluated inotuzumab ozogamicin and dexamethasone (Dex) as induction therapy in older patients with ALL within the German Multicenter Study Group for Adult ALL (GMALL).

Patients and Methods: The open-label, multicenter, phase II, INITIAL-1 trial enrolled 45 patients older than 55 years with newly diagnosed, CD22-positive, BCR::ABL-negative B-precursor ALL (B-ALL). Patients received up to three cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin/Dex and up to six cycles of age-adapted GMALL consolidation and maintenance therapy.

Results: Forty-three evaluable patients with common/pre-B (n = 38) and pro-B ALL (n = 5), with a median age of 64 years (range, 56-80), received at least two cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin induction therapy. All patients achieved complete remission (CR/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery). Twenty-three (53%) and 30 (71%) patients had no evidence of molecularly assessed measurable residual disease (minimum 10e−4 threshold) after the second and third inductions, respectively. After a median follow-up of 2.7 years, event-free survival at one (primary end point) and 3 years was 88% (95% CI, 79 to 98) and 55% (95% CI, 40 to 71), while overall survival (OS) was 91% (95% CI, 82 to 99) and 73% (95% CI, 59 to 87), respectively. None of the patients died during 6 months after the start of induction. Most common adverse events having common toxicity criteria grade ≥3 during induction were leukocytopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes. One patient developed nonfatal veno-occlusive disease after induction II.

Conclusion: Inotuzumab ozogamicin–based induction followed by age-adapted chemotherapy was well tolerated and resulted in high rates of remission and OS. These data provide a rationale for integrating inotuzumab ozogamicin into first-line regimens for older patients with B-ALL.",1/20/2024,JCO.23.00546,{}

Patients and Methods: Patients with HER2-negative AGC from eight Korean cancer centers were screened for druggable targets using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization, and randomly assigned to the biomarker versus control group at a 4:1 ratio. In the biomarker group, patients were treated with specific targeted agent plus paclitaxel: pan-ERBB inhibitor for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 2+/3+ patients (afatinib; EGFR cohort), PIK3Cβ inhibitor for phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss/null patients (GSK2636771; PTEN cohort), and anti–PD-1 inhibitor for PD-L1+, deficient mismatch repair/microsatellite instability-high, or Epstein-Barr virus–related cases (nivolumab; NIVO cohort). NONE cohort in the biomarker group without predefined biomarkers and control group received SOC (paclitaxel with or without ramucirumab). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary end points were efficacy and safety.

Results: A total of 318 patients were randomly assigned into the control (n = 64) and biomarker (n = 254; EGFR, n = 67; PTEN, n = 37; NIVO, n = 48; NONE, n = 102) groups. Median follow-up was 35 months. Median PFS and overall survival (OS) were 3.7 (95% CI, 3.1 to 4.1) and 8.6 (95% CI, 7.6 to 9.8) months in the biomarker group and 4.0 (95% CI, 3.0 to 4.6) and 8.7 (95% CI, 7.1 to 9.9) months in the control group. Afatinib addition led to marginal survival benefits to patients with EGFR 3+ compared with SOC (PFS, 4.0 v 2.2 months; P = .09), but GSK2636771 did not prolong the survival of patients with PTEN loss. Addition of nivolumab showed a durable survival benefit (median OS, 12.0 v 7.6 months; P = .08).

Conclusion: Although biomarker group did not show better survival than the control group, IHC-based screening and allocation of patients with AGC to the second-line treatment in an umbrella design were feasible for effective early screening of novel agents.",1/20/2024,JCO.23.00971,{}
Efficacy and Safety of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Patients With HER2-Expressing Solid Tumors: Primary Results From the DESTINY-PanTumor02 Phase II Trial,Funda  Meric-Bernstam; Vicky  Makker; Ana  Oaknin; Do-Youn  Oh; Susana  Banerjee; Antonio  González-Martín; Kyung Hae  Jung; Iwona  Ługowska; Luis  Manso; Aránzazu  Manzano; Bohuslav  Melichar; Salvatore  Siena; Daniil  Stroyakovskiy; Anitra  Fielding; Yan  Ma; Soham  Puvvada; Norah  Shire; Jung-Yun  Lee,TX; NY; NY; Spain; South Korea; United Kingdom; Spain; South Korea; Poland; Spain; Spain; Czech Republic; Italy; Russia; MD; United Kingdom; MD; MD; South Korea,"Purpose: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)–directed antibody-drug conjugate approved in HER2-expressing breast and gastric cancers and HER2-mutant non–small-cell lung cancer. Treatments are limited for other HER2-expressing solid tumors.

Methods: This open-label phase II study evaluated T-DXd (5.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks) for HER2-expressing (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+/2+ by local or central testing) locally advanced or metastatic disease after ≥1 systemic treatment or without alternative treatments. The primary end point was investigator-assessed confirmed objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end points included safety, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

Results: At primary analysis, 267 patients received treatment across seven tumor cohorts: endometrial, cervical, ovarian, bladder, biliary tract, pancreatic, and other. The median follow-up was 12.75 months. In all patients, the ORR was 37.1% (n = 99; [95% CI, 31.3 to 43.2]), with responses in all cohorts; the median DOR was 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.6 to 17.8); the median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 8.0); and the median OS was 13.4 months (95% CI, 11.9 to 15.5). In patients with central HER2 IHC 3+ expression (n = 75), the ORR was 61.3% (95% CI, 49.4 to 72.4), the median DOR was 22.1 months (95% CI, 9.6 to not reached), the median PFS was 11.9 months (95% CI, 8.2 to 13.0), and the median OS was 21.1 months (95% CI, 15.3 to 29.6). Grade ≥3 drug-related adverse events were observed in 40.8% of patients; 10.5% experienced adjudicated drug-related interstitial lung disease (ILD), with three deaths.

Conclusion: Our study demonstrates durable clinical benefit, meaningful survival outcomes, and safety consistent with the known profile (including ILD) in pretreated patients with HER2-expressing tumors receiving T-DXd. Greatest benefit was observed for the IHC 3+ population. These data support the potential role of T-DXd as a tumor-agnostic therapy for patients with HER2-expressing solid tumors.",1/1/2024,JCO.23.02005,"{'Funda Meric-Bernstam': ['Employment: MD Anderson Cancer Center', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: F.

Adding a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor may improve outcomes, especially in pMMR disease.

Methods: This phase III, global, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomly assigned eligible patients with newly diagnosed advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer 1:1:1 to: carboplatin/paclitaxel plus durvalumab placebo followed by placebo maintenance (control arm); carboplatin/paclitaxel plus durvalumab followed by maintenance durvalumab plus olaparib placebo (durvalumab arm); or carboplatin/paclitaxel plus durvalumab followed by maintenance durvalumab plus olaparib (durvalumab + olaparib arm). The primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) in the durvalumab arm versus control and the durvalumab + olaparib arm versus control.

Results: Seven hundred eighteen patients were randomly assigned. In the intention-to-treat population, statistically significant PFS benefit was observed in the durvalumab (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.89]; P = .003) and durvalumab + olaparib arms (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.69]; P < .0001) versus control. Prespecified, exploratory subgroup analyses showed PFS benefit in dMMR (HR [durvalumab v control], 0.42 [95% CI, 0.22 to 0.80]; HR [durvalumab + olaparib v control], 0.41 [95% CI, 0.21 to 0.75]) and pMMR subgroups (HR [durvalumab v control], 0.77 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.97]; HR [durvalumab + olaparib v control] 0.57; [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.73]); and in PD-L1–positive subgroups (HR [durvalumab v control], 0.63 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.83]; HR [durvalumab + olaparib v control], 0.42 [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.57]). Interim overall survival results (maturity approximately 28%) were supportive of the primary outcomes (durvalumab v control: HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.56 to 1.07]; P = .120; durvalumab + olaparib v control: HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.83]; P = .003). The safety profiles of the experimental arms were generally consistent with individual agents.

Conclusion: Carboplatin/paclitaxel plus durvalumab followed by maintenance durvalumab with or without olaparib demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful PFS benefit in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.",1/20/2024,JCO.23.02132,"{'Shannon N.

This randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase III study evaluates the efficacy of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin (ABCP ) in EGFR- or ALK-rearranged or translocated NSCLC upon progression on TKI therapy.

Materials and Methods: We compared the clinical efficacy of ABCP followed by maintenance therapy with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with pemetrexed plus carboplatin or cisplatin (PC) followed by pemetrexed maintenance. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).

Results: A total of 228 patients with activating EGFR mutation (n = 215) or ALK translocation (n = 13) were enrolled from 16 sites in the Republic of Korea and randomly assigned at 2:1 ratio to either ABCP (n = 154) or PC arm (n = 74). The median follow-up duration was 26.1 months (95% CI, 24.7 to 28.2). Objective response rates (69.5% v 41.9%, P < .001) and median PFS (8.48 v 5.62 months, hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.86]; P = .004) were significantly better in the ABCP than PC arm. PFS benefit increased as PD-L1 expression increased, with an HR of 0.47, 0.41, and 0.24 for PD-L1 ≥1%, ≥10%, and ≥50%, respectively. Overall survival was similar between ABCP and PC arm (20.63 v 20.27 months, HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.46]; P = .975). The safety profile of the ABCP arm was comparable with that previously reported, with no additional safety signals, but higher rates of treatment-related adverse events were observed compared with the PC arm.

Pancreatic tumors often overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (HER1/EGFR) and this is associated with a worse prognosis. We studied the effects of adding the HER1/EGFR-targeted agent erlotinib to gemcitabine in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Patients and Methods: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive standard gemcitabine plus erlotinib (100 or 150 mg/d orally) or gemcitabine plus placebo in a double-blind, international phase III trial. The primary end point was overall survival.

Results: A total of 569 patients were randomly assigned. Overall survival based on an intent-to-treat analysis was significantly prolonged on the erlotinib/gemcitabine arm with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99; P = .038, adjusted for stratification factors; median 6.24 months v 5.91 months). One-year survival was also greater with erlotinib plus gemcitabine (23% v 17%; P = .023). Progression-free survival was significantly longer with erlotinib plus gemcitabine with an estimated HR of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.92; P = .004). Objective response rates were not significantly different between the arms, although more patients on erlotinib had disease stabilization. There was a higher incidence of some adverse events with erlotinib plus gemcitabine, but most were grade 1 or 2.

Conclusion: To our knowledge, this randomized phase III trial is the first to demonstrate statistically significantly improved survival in advanced pancreatic cancer by adding any agent to gemcitabine. The recommended dose of erlotinib with gemcitabine for this indication is 100 mg/d.",10/20/2023,JCO.22.02770,{}

Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) is an investigational HER3-targeted antibody-drug conjugate that is being evaluated as a novel treatment in HER3-expressing advanced breast cancer in the U31402-A-J101 study.

Methods: Adults with disease progression on previous therapies were eligible. Patients in the dose-escalation, dose-finding, and dose-expansion parts received HER3-DXd 1.6-8.0 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks or one of two alternative dosing regimens. In the dose-escalation part, the primary objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for expansion (RDE). The safety and efficacy of the RDE were assessed during dose expansion.

Results: One hundred eighty-two enrolled patients received ≥1 dose of HER3-DXd. Patients had a median of five previous therapies for advanced disease. Efficacy results are reported across clinical subtypes: hormone receptor–positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HER2-negative) breast cancer (n = 113; objective response rate [ORR], 30.1%; median progression-free survival [mPFS], 7.4 months), triple-negative breast cancer (n = 53; ORR, 22.6%; mPFS, 5.5 months), and HER2-positive breast cancer (n = 14; ORR, 42.9%; mPFS, 11.0 months). Objective responses were observed in cancers with HER3-high and HER3-low membrane expression. Dose-limiting toxicities observed during dose selection were decreased platelet count and elevated aminotransferases. In dose expansion, GI and hematologic toxicities were the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) observed. Grade ≥3 TEAEs were observed in 71.4% of patients, and 9.9% discontinued treatment because of TEAEs. Three grade 3 and one grade 5 treatment-related interstitial lung disease events occurred.

Conclusion: HER3-DXd demonstrated a manageable safety profile and durable efficacy in heavily pretreated patients across clinical subtypes. These data warrant further evaluation of HER3-DXd in patients with HER3-expressing metastatic breast cancer.",12/20/2023,JCO.23.00882,"{'Ian E.

Concurrent Chemotherapy and Pelvic Radiation Therapy Compared With Pelvic Radiation Therapy Alone as Adjuvant Therapy After Radical Surgery in High-Risk Early-Stage Cancer of the Cervix,William A.  Peters III; P.Y.  Liu; Rolland J.  Barrett II; Richard J.  Stock; Bradley J.  Monk; Jonathan S.  Berek; Luis  Souhami; Perry  Grigsby; William  Gordon Jr; David S.  Alberts,AZ.; AZ.; AZ.; AZ.; AZ.; AZ.; AZ.; AZ.; AZ.; AZ.,"Purpose: To determine whether the addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CT) to pelvic radiation therapy (RT) will improve the survival of early-stage, high-risk patients with cervical carcinoma.

Patients and Methods: Patients with clinical stage IA2, IB, and IIA carcinoma of the cervix, initially treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, and who had positive pelvic lymph nodes and/or positive margins and/or microscopic involvement of the parametrium were eligible for this study. Patients were randomized to receive RT or RT + CT. Patients in each group received 49.3 GY RT in 29 fractions to a standard pelvic field. Chemotherapy consisted of bolus cisplatin 70 mg/m2 and a 96-hour infusion of fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m2/d every 3 weeks for four cycles, with the first and second cycles given concurrent to RT.

Results: Between 1991 and 1996, 268 patients were entered onto the study. Two hundred forty-three patients were assessable (127 RT + CT patients and 116 RT patients). Progression-free and overall survival are significantly improved in the patients receiving CT. The hazard ratios for progression-free survival and overall survival in the RT only arm versus the RT + CT arm are 2.01 (P = .003) and 1.96 (P = .007), respectively. The projected progression-free survivals at 4 years is 63% with RT and 80% with RT + CT. The projected overall survival rate at 4 years is 71% with RT and 81% with RT + CT. Grades 3 and 4 hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity were more frequent in the RT + CT group.

Conclusion: The addition of concurrent cisplatin-based CT to RT significantly improves progression-free and overall survival for high-risk, early-stage patients who undergo radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for carcinoma of the cervix.",10/10/2023,JCO.22.02769,{}

The interleukin (IL)-1β pathway has been linked with tumor development and progression, including in the Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes cardiovascular study in which IL-1β pathway inhibition with canakinumab reduced lung cancer incidence and mortality in an exploratory analysis.

Methods: CANOPY-A (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03447769) is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of canakinumab versus placebo for adult patients with stage II-IIIA or IIIB (T >5 cm, N2-positives II-IIIB; American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control version 8), completely resected NSCLC who had received adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) and the key secondary end point was overall survival (OS).

Results: In total, 1,382 patients were randomized to 200 mg canakinumab (n = 693) or placebo (n = 689) once every 3 weeks for 18 cycles. Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 20.8% and 19.6% of patients receiving canakinumab and placebo, respectively; AEs led to discontinuation in 4.3% and 4.1% of patients in these groups, respectively. This study did not meet its primary end point. Median DFS was 35.0 months (canakinumab arm) and 29.7 months (placebo arm; hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.14; one-sided P = .258). DFS subgroup analyses did not show any meaningful differences between arms. As expected, because of canakinumab-driven IL-1β pathway inhibition, C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels decreased in the canakinumab arm versus placebo arm, but had no correlation with differential clinical outcomes. OS was not formally tested as DFS was not statistically significant.

Conclusion: CANOPY-A did not show a DFS benefit of adding canakinumab after surgery and adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with resected, stage II-III NSCLC. No new safety signals were identified with canakinumab.",1/10/2024,JCO.23.00910,"{'Edward B.

Methods: SGNTUC-019 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04579380) is an open-label phase II basket study evaluating the efficacy and safety of tucatinib and trastuzumab in patients with HER2-altered solid tumors. In the biliary tract cancer cohort, patients had previously treated HER2 overexpressing or amplified (HER2+) tumors (identified with local testing) with no prior HER2-directed therapy. The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (cORR) per investigator assessment. Patients were treated on a 21-day cycle with tucatinib (300 mg orally twice daily) and trastuzumab (8 mg/kg intravenously followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks).

Results: Thirty patients were enrolled. As of data cutoff (January 30, 2023), the median duration of follow-up was 10.8 months. The cORR was 46.7% (90% CI, 30.8 to 63.0), with a disease control rate of 76.7% (90% CI, 60.6 to 88.5). The median duration of response and progression-free survival were 6.0 months (90% CI, 5.5 to 6.9) and 5.5 months (90% CI, 3.9 to 8.1), respectively. At data cutoff, 15 patients (50.0%) had died, and the estimated 12-month overall survival rate was 53.6% (90% CI, 36.8 to 67.8). The two most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were pyrexia (43.3%) and diarrhea (40.0%). Grade ≥3 TEAEs were reported in 18 patients (60.0%), with the most common being cholangitis, decreased appetite, and nausea (all 10.0%), which were generally not treatment related. TEAEs led to treatment regimen discontinuation in one patient, and there were no deaths due to TEAEs.

Conclusion: Tucatinib combined with trastuzumab had clinically significant antitumor activity and was well tolerated in patients with previously treated HER2+ mBTC.",12/20/2023,JCO.23.00606,"{'Yoshiaki Nakamura': ['Honoraria: Chugai Pharma, Guardant Health AMEA, Merck', 'Research Funding: Taiho Pharmaceutical (Inst), Guardant Health (Inst), Genomedia (Inst), Chugai Pharma (Inst), Seagen (Inst), Roche (Inst)'], 'Nobumasa Mizuno': ['Honoraria: Yakult Honsha, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Fujifilm, Taiho Pharmaceutical', 'Research Funding: MSD (Inst), Incyte (Inst), Ono Pharmaceutical (Inst), Seagen (Inst), Novartis (Inst)'], 'Yu Sunakawa': ['Honoraria: Taiho Pharmaceutical, Chugai Pharma, Takeda, Bayer Yakuhin, Bristol Myers Squibb Japan, Lilly Japan, Merck, Sysmex, MSD K.K, Ono Pharmaceutical, Daiichi Sankyo, Guardant Health, Incyte', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb Japan, MSD K.K, Daiichi Sankyo, Merck', 'Research Funding: Taiho Pharmaceutical, Takeda, Chugai Pharma, Lilly Japan, Otsuka'], 'Jean-Luc Canon': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo, Lilly, Seagen', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo, Lilly, Seagen, Sanofi', 'Research Funding: Roche/Genentech (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Daiichi Sankyo/Astra Zeneca, Roche/Genentech'], 'Matthew D.

Yang,NY; WA; NY; MO; NY; NY; NY; NY; NY; FL; PAa; NY; NY; NY; NY; NY; NY; NY; NY; NY; TN; NY; NY; CA; NY; WA,"Purpose: External-beam radiation therapy (RT) is standard of care (SOC) for pain relief of symptomatic bone metastases. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of radiation to asymptomatic bone metastases in preventing skeletal-related events (SRE).

Methods: In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, adult patients with widely metastatic solid tumor malignancies were stratified by histology and planned SOC (systemic therapy or observation) and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive RT to asymptomatic high-risk bone metastases or SOC alone. The primary outcome of the trial was SRE. Secondary outcomes included hospitalizations for SRE and overall survival (OS).

Results: A total of 78 patients with 122 high-risk bone metastases were enrolled between May 8, 2018, and August 9, 2021, at three institutions across an affiliated cancer network in the United States. Seventy-three patients were evaluable for the primary end point. The most common primary cancer types were lung (27%), breast (24%), and prostate (22%). At 1 year, SRE occurred in one of 62 bone metastases (1.6%) in the RT arm and 14 of 49 bone metastases (29%) in the SOC arm (P < .001). There were significantly fewer patients hospitalized for SRE in the RT arm compared with the SOC arm (0 v 4, P = .045). At a median follow-up of 2.5 years, OS was significantly longer in the RT arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.89; P = .018), which persisted on multivariable Cox regression analysis (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.85; P = .01).

Conclusion: Radiation delivered prophylactically to asymptomatic, high-risk bone metastases reduced SRE and hospitalizations. We also observed an improvement in OS with prophylactic radiation, although a confirmatory phase III trial is warranted.",1/1/2024,JCO.23.00753,{}

Materials and Methods: All patients were affected by oligometastatic CRPC as defined as three or less nonvisceral metastatic lesions. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either AAP alone (control arm) or AAP with concomitant SBRT to all the sites of disease (experimental arm). Primary end point was the rate of biochemical response (BR), defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decrease ≥50% from baseline measured at 6 months from treatment start. Complete BR (CBR), defined as PSA < 0.2 ng/mL at 6 months from treatment, and progression-free survival (PFS) were secondary end points.

Results: One hundred and fifty-seven patients were enrolled between January 2019 and September 2022. BR was detected in 79.6% of patients (92% v 68.3% in the experimental v control arm, respectively), with an odds ratio (OR) of 5.34 (95% CI, 2.05 to 13.88; P = .001) in favor of the experimental arm. CBR was detected in 38.8% of patients (56% v 23.2% in the experimental v control arm, respectively), with an OR of 4.22 (95% CI, 2.12 to 8.38; P < .001). SBRT yielded a significant PFS improvement, with a hazard ratio for progression of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.57; P < .001) in the experimental versus control arm.

Conclusion: The trial reached its primary end point of biochemical control and PFS, suggesting a clinical advantage for SBRT in addition to first-line AAP treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.",12/20/2023,JCO.23.00985,"{'Alessio Bruni': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche, Ipsen, Janssen', 'Uncompensated Relationships: AstraZeneca'], 'Gianluca Ingrosso': ['Honoraria: Ipsen, Takeda, Bayer', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Ipsen'], ""Rolando Maria D'Angelillo"": ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Astellas Pharma, Bayer, Ferring, Ipsen, Janssen Oncology', 'Research Funding: Janssen Oncology'], 'Anna Rita Alitto': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Janssen Oncology'], 'Matteo Augugliaro': ['Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Ipsen'], 'Gabriele Simontacchi': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Eisai Europe'], 'Icro Meattini': ['Honoraria: Lilly, Novartis, Pfizer, Seagen, Accuray']}"

Three initial experimental arms (abemaciclib [a cyclin-dependent kinase [CDK]4/6 inhibitor], neratinib [an epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 inhibitor], and CC-115 [a deoxyribonucleic acid–dependent protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor]) were simultaneously evaluated against a common control arm. We report the results for each arm and examine the feasibility and conduct of the adaptive platform design.

Patients and Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed O6-methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase-unmethylated glioblastoma were eligible if they had tumor genotyping to identify prespecified biomarker subpopulations of dominant glioblastoma signaling pathways (EGFR, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and CDK). Initial random assignment was 1:1:1:1 between control (radiation therapy and temozolomide) and the experimental arms. Subsequent Bayesian adaptive randomization was incorporated on the basis of biomarker-specific progression-free survival (PFS) data. The primary end point was overall survival (OS), and one-sided P values are reported. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02977780).

Results: Two hundred thirty-seven patients were treated (71 control; 73 abemaciclib; 81 neratinib; 12 CC-115) in years 2017-2021. Abemaciclib and neratinib were well tolerated, but CC-115 was associated with ≥ grade 3 treatment-related toxicity in 58% of patients. PFS was significantly longer with abemaciclib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.06; one-sided P = .046) and neratinib (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.02; one-sided P = .033) relative to the control arm but there was no PFS benefit with CC-115 (one-sided P = .523). None of the experimental therapies demonstrated a significant OS benefit (P > .05).

Conclusion: The INSIGhT design enabled efficient simultaneous testing of three experimental agents using a shared control arm and adaptive randomization. Two investigational arms had superior PFS compared with the control arm, but none demonstrated an OS benefit. The INSIGhT design may promote improved and more efficient therapeutic discovery in glioblastoma. New arms have been added to the trial.",12/20/2023,JCO.23.00493,"{'Rifaquat Rahman': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Beijing Saint Lucia Consulting', 'Research Funding: Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Puma Biotechnology (Inst), Lilly (Inst)'], 'Lorenzo Trippa': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Galera Therapeutics', 'Research Funding: Candel Therapeutics (Inst)'], 'Eudocia Q.

The present invention provides an association between copy loss of SF3B1 in cancer and sensitivity to SF3B1 suppression. Cancer cells harboring partial SF3B1 copy-loss are more sensitive because they lack a reservoir of SF3b complex that protects cells with normal SF3B1 copy number from cell death upon SF3B1 suppression. The invention also provides methods for treating cancer, especially cancer with SF3B1 copy loss, by suppressing the expression or activity of SF3B1.

We present exploratory patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

Methods: In patients (N = 1,581) concurrently randomly assigned 1:1 to nivolumab plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy and in those with tumor PD-L1 expression at a combined positive score (CPS) of ≥5, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the EQ-5D and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Gastric (FACT-Ga), which included the FACT-General (FACT-G) and Gastric Cancer subscale (GaCS). The FACT-G GP5 item assessed treatment-related symptom burden. Longitudinal changes in HRQoL were assessed using mixed models for repeated measures in the PRO analysis population (randomly assigned patients with baseline and ≥1 postbaseline assessments). Time to symptom or definitive deterioration analyses were also conducted.

Results: In the PRO analysis population (n = 1,360), PRO questionnaire completion rates were mostly >80% during treatment. Patient-reported symptom burden was not increased with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy. Mean improved changes from baseline were greater with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy for FACT-Ga total, GaCS, and EQ-5D visual analog scale in patients with a CPS of ≥5; results were similar for the overall PRO analysis population. In CPS ≥5 and all randomly assigned populations, nivolumab plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of symptom deterioration versus chemotherapy, on the basis of FACT-Ga total score and GaCS; time to definitive deterioration was longer, and the risk of definitive deterioration in HRQoL was reduced with nivolumab plus chemotherapy across EQ-5D and most FACT-Ga measures (hazard ratio [95% CI] <1).

Conclusion: Compared with chemotherapy alone, first-line nivolumab plus chemotherapy showed stable or better on-treatment HRQoL in patients with advanced/metastatic non–HER2-positive GC/GEJC/EAC and also showed decreased risk of definitive HRQoL deterioration.",12/10/2023,JCO.23.00170,"{'Markus Moehler': ['Honoraria: Amgen, Roche/Genentech, Merck Serono, MSD Oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Servier, Pierre Fabre, Sanofi', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Bayer, MSD, Merck Serono, Amgen, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Pfizer, Roche, Lilly, Servier, BeiGene, BMS, AstraZeneca', 'Research Funding: Amgen (Inst), Leap Therapeutics (Inst), Merck Serono (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), MSD (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Amgen, Merck Serono, Roche, Bayer, ASCO, German Cancer Society, MSD, ESMO, BeiGene'], 'Hong Xiao': ['Employment: Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene'], 'Steven I.

Azacitidine upregulates prophagocytic signals on AML cells, further increasing phagocytosis when combined with magrolimab. We report final phase Ib data for magrolimab with azacitidine in patients with untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03248479).

Patients and Methods: Patients with previously untreated AML, including TP53-mutant AML, received magrolimab intravenously as an initial dose (1 mg/kg, days 1 and 4), followed by 15 mg/kg once on day 8 and 30 mg/kg once weekly or every 2 weeks as maintenance. Azacitidine 75 mg/m2 was administered intravenously/subcutaneously once daily on days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle. Primary end points were safety/tolerability and proportion with complete remission (CR).

Results: Eighty-seven patients were enrolled and treated; 72 (82.8%) had TP53 mutations with a median variant allele frequency of 61% (range, 9.8-98.7). Fifty-seven (79.2%) of TP53-mutant patients had European LeukemiaNet 2017 adverse-risk cytogenetics. Patients received a median of 4 (range, 1-39) cycles of treatment. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included constipation (49.4%), nausea (49.4%), and diarrhea (48.3%). Thirty (34.5%) experienced anemia, and the median hemoglobin change from baseline to first postdose assessment was –0.9 g/dL (range, –3.6 to 2.5 g/dL). Twenty-eight (32.2%) patients achieved CR, including 23 (31.9%) patients with TP53 mutations. The median overall survival in TP53-mutant and wild-type patients were 9.8 months and 18.9 months, respectively.

Conclusion: Magrolimab with azacitidine was relatively well tolerated with promising efficacy in patients with AML ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy, including those with TP53 mutations, warranting further evaluation of magrolimab with azacitidine in AML.

We performed a genomic profile-based umbrella trial for the patients with platinum-refractory recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC.

Methods: In this multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase II trial, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Patients were assigned to each treatment arm on the basis of their matching genomic profiles: arm 1, alpelisib, a PIK3CA inhibitor; arm 2, poziotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor/HER2 inhibitor; arm 3, nintedanib, an fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor; and arm 4, abemaciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor. If there was no matching target, patients were allocated to arm 5, duvalumab ± tremelimumab, anti–PD-L1/cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 inhibitor. When progressive disease (PD) occurred in arms 1-4, cross over to arm 5 was allowed. The primary end point was disease control rate (DCR) in arm 1 and overall response rate (ORR) in arms 2-5 by investigator assessment.

Results: Between October 2017 and August 2020, 203 patients were enrolled, including crossover. In arm 1, the ORR was 21.2% and DCR was 65.6%. The ORR was 0% for arm 2, 42.9% for arm 3, 0% for arm 4, and 15.6% for arm 5. In the case of PD with durvalumab, tremelimumab was added, and the ORR for durvalumab + tremelimumab was 2.2%. The median progression-free survival was 3.4, 3.2, 5.6, 1.6, and 1.7 months for each arm, respectively. The median overall survival was 12.4, 6.1, 11.1, 9.1, and 12.7 months, respectively. Overall, the toxicity profiles were manageable, and there were no treatment-related deaths.

Conclusion: To our knowledge, this study is the first biomarker-driven umbrella trial for platinum-refractory HNSCC using matched molecular targeted agents.

Methods: DESTINY-Lung02, a blinded, multicenter, phase II study, investigated T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for the first time in previously treated (platinum-containing therapy) patients with HER2m mNSCLC and further assessed T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks in this population. The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review.

Results: One hundred fifty-two patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to T-DXd 5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. As of December 23, 2022, the median duration of follow-up was 11.5 months (range, 1.1-20.6) with 5.4 mg/kg and 11.8 months (range, 0.6-21.0) with 6.4 mg/kg. Confirmed ORR was 49.0% (95% CI, 39.0 to 59.1) and 56.0% (95% CI, 41.3 to 70.0) and median duration of response was 16.8 months (95% CI, 6.4 to not estimable [NE]) and NE (95% CI, 8.3 to NE) with 5.4 and 6.4 mg/kg, respectively. Median treatment duration was 7.7 months (range, 0.7-20.8) with 5.4 mg/kg and 8.3 months (range, 0.7-20.3) with 6.4 mg/kg. Grade ≥ 3 drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 39 of 101 (38.6%) and 29 of 50 (58.0%) patients with 5.4 and 6.4 mg/kg, respectively. 13 of 101 (12.9%) and 14 of 50 (28.0%) patients had adjudicated drug-related interstitial lung disease (2.0% grade ≥ 3 in each arm) with 5.4 and 6.4 mg/kg, respectively.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of HER3-DXd in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–mutated non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods: This phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04619004) was designed to evaluate HER3-DXd in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC previously treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC). Patients received HER3-DXd 5.6 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks or an uptitration regimen (3.2 → 4.8 → 6.4 mg/kg). The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (ORR; RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review (BICR), with a null hypothesis of 26.4% on the basis of historical data.

Results: Enrollment into the uptitration arm closed early on the basis of a prespecified benefit-risk assessment of data from the phase I U31402-A-U102 trial. In total, 225 patients received HER3-DXd 5.6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. As of May 18, 2023, median study duration was 18.9 (range, 14.9-27.5) months. Confirmed ORR by BICR was 29.8% (95% CI, 23.9 to 36.2); median duration of response, 6.4 months; median progression-free survival, 5.5 months; and median overall survival, 11.9 months. The subgroup of patients with previous osimertinib and PBC had similar outcomes. Efficacy was observed across a broad range of pretreatment tumor HER3 membrane expression levels and across diverse mechanisms of EGFR TKI resistance. In patients with nonirradiated brain metastases at baseline (n = 30), the confirmed CNS ORR by BICR per CNS RECIST was 33.3% (95% CI, 17.3 to 52.8). The safety profile (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0) was manageable and tolerable, consistent with previous observations.

Conclusion: After tumor progression with EGFR TKI therapy and PBC in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, HER3-DXd once every 3 weeks demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy with durable responses, including in CNS metastases. A phase III trial in EGFR-mutated NSCLC after progression on an EGFR TKI is ongoing (HERTHENA-Lung02; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05338970).",12/10/2023,JCO.23.01476,"{'Helena A.

The primary end point was to assess progression-free survival (PFS) with once-weekly oral selinexor in patients with advanced or recurrent EC.

Patients and Methods: ENGOT-EN5/GOG-3055/SIENDO was a randomized, prospective, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study at 107 sites in 10 countries. Patients 18 years or older with histologically confirmed EC were enrolled. All had completed a single line of at least 12 weeks of taxane-platinum combination chemotherapy and achieved partial or complete response. Patients were assigned to receive 80 mg oral selinexor once weekly or placebo with 2:1 random assignment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03555422).

Results: Between January 2018 and December 2021, 263 patients were randomly assigned, with 174 allocated to selinexor and 89 to placebo. The median PFS was 5.7 months (95% CI, 3.81 to 9.20) with selinexor versus 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.68 to 7.39) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.54 to 1.08]; two-sided P = .126), which did not meet the criteria for statistical significance in the intent-to-treat population. Incorrect chemotherapy response stratification data for 7 (2.7%) patients were identified. In a prespecified exploratory analysis of PFS in audited stratification data, PFS for selinexor met the threshold for statistical significance (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.499 to 0.996; two-sided P = .049). Furthermore, patients with the TP53 wild-type (wt) EC had a median PFS of 13.7 and 3.7 months with selinexor and placebo. The most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse events were nausea (9%), neutropenia (9%), and thrombocytopenia (7%).

Conclusion: The significance level for PFS was only met in the audited analysis. However, a preliminary analysis of a prespecified exploratory subgroup of patients with TP53wt EC showed promising results with selinexor maintenance therapy.",12/10/2023,JCO.22.02906,"{'Ignace

Methods: Between May 2002 and January 2014, 626 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB2-IIb were randomly assigned between neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery (NACT-S; n = 314) and standard CCRT (n = 312). The primary end point was 5-year overall survival (OS) rate. Secondary end points were progression-free survival, OS, toxicity, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

Results: After a median follow-up of 8.7 years, 198 patients (31.6%) died. Age, stage, and cell type were balanced in both arms. Protocol treatment was completed in 223 of 314 (71%) patients in NACT-S and 257 of 312(82%) in CCRT arms. Main reasons for incomplete protocol treatment were toxicity (30 of 314; 9.6%) and progressive disease (21 of 314; 6.7%) in the NACT-S arm and toxicity (23 of 312; 7.4%) and patient refusal (13 of 312; 4.2%) in the CCRT arm. Additional radiotherapy after completed NACT-S was given to 107 patients (48%), and additional surgery to 20 patients (8%) after completed CCRT. Short-term adverse events (AEs) ≥grade 3 occurred more frequently with NACT-S (41% v 23%), and long-term AEs ≥grade 3 more often with CCRT (21% v 15%). The 5-year OS was not significantly different between NACT-S (72%; 95% CI, 66 to 77) and CCRT (76%; 95% CI, 70 to 80).

Relative dose intensity (RDI), defined as the ratio of chemotherapy delivered to prescribed, is a measure of chemotherapy completion and is associated with cancer mortality. The effect of exercise and eating a healthy diet on RDI is unknown. We conducted a randomized trial of an exercise and nutrition intervention on RDI and pathologic complete response (pCR) in women diagnosed with breast cancer initiating chemotherapy.

Methods: One hundred seventy-three women with stage I-III breast cancer were randomly assigned to usual care (UC; n = 86) or a home-based exercise and nutrition intervention with counseling sessions delivered by oncology-certified registered dietitians (n = 87). Chemotherapy dose adjustments and delays and pCR were abstracted from electronic medical records. T-tests and chi-square tests were used to examine the effect of the intervention versus UC on RDI and pCR.

Results: Participants randomly assigned to intervention had greater improvements in exercise and diet quality compared with UC (P < .05). RDI was 92.9% ± 12.1% and 93.6% ± 11.1% for intervention and UC, respectively (P = .69); the proportion of patients in the intervention versus UC who achieved ≥85% RDI was 81% and 85%, respectively (P = .44). The proportion of patients who had at least one dose reduction and/or delay was 38% intervention and 36% UC (P = .80). Among 72 women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, women randomly assigned to intervention were more likely to have a pCR than those randomly assigned to UC (53% v 28%; P = .037).

Conclusion: Although a diet and exercise intervention did not affect RDI, the intervention was associated with a higher pCR in patients with hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative and triple-negative breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",12/1/2023,JCO.23.00871,"{'Tara Sanft': [""Speakers' Bureau: Hologic/Biotheranostics""], 'Brenda Cartmel': ['Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Pfizer'], 'Fang-Yong Li': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Yiviva'], 'Dawn L.

This phase Ib/II study evaluated TV in combination with bevacizumab, pembrolizumab, or carboplatin for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer (r/mCC).

Methods: This open-label, multicenter study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03786081) included dose-escalation arms that assessed dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and identified the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of TV in combination with bevacizumab (arm A), pembrolizumab (arm B), or carboplatin (arm C). The dose-expansion arms evaluated TV antitumor activity and safety at RP2D in combination with carboplatin as first-line (1L) treatment (arm D) or with pembrolizumab as 1L (arm E) or second-/third-line (2L/3L) treatment (arm F). The primary end point of dose expansion was objective response rate (ORR).

Results: A total of 142 patients were enrolled. In dose escalation (n = 41), no DLTs were observed; the RP2D was TV 2 mg/kg plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg on day 1 once every 3 weeks, pembrolizumab 200 mg on day 1 once every 3 weeks, or carboplatin AUC 5 on day 1 once every 3 weeks. In dose expansion (n = 101), the ORR was 54.5% (n/N, 18/33; 95% CI, 36.4 to 71.9) with 1L TV + carboplatin (arm D), 40.6% (n/N, 13/32; 95% CI, 23.7 to 59.4) with 1L TV + pembrolizumab (arm E), and 35.3% (12/34; 19.7 to 53.5) with 2L/3L TV + pembrolizumab (arm F). The median duration of response was 8.6 months, not reached, and 14.1 months, in arms D, E, and F, respectively. Grade ≥3 adverse events (≥15%) were anemia, diarrhea, nausea, and thrombocytopenia in arm D and anemia in arm F (none ≥15%, arm E).

Therefore, we conducted a phase III clinical study to verify the efficacy and safety of this combination regimen in patients with K-Ras wild-type tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02395016).

Patients and Methods: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive nimotuzumab (400 mg once per week) or placebo followed by gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15, once every 4 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) and the secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), response rates, and safety.

Results: A total of 480 patients were screened; 92 patients were enrolled and 82 patients with K-Ras wild-type tumors were eligible. In the full analysis set, the median OS was 10.9 versus 8.5 months, while the restricted mean survival time (RMST) was 18.05 versus 11.14 months for the investigational versus control arm (ratio of control v investigation = 0.62 [0.40-0.97]; P = .036). Median PFS was 4.2 versus 3.6 months in the investigational versus control arm (log-rank P = .04; hazard ratio, 0.60 [0.37-0.99]) and the restricted mean PFS time was 8.08 versus 4.76 months (RMST ratio, 0.58 [0.38-0.90]; P = .036). Both OS and PFS were longer in the nimotuzumab group than in the placebo group. The objective response rates and disease control rates were 7% versus 10% and 68% versus 63% for the investigational and control groups, respectively. The incidence of adverse events were comparable between the two groups.

Conclusion: In patients with locally advanced or metastatic K-Ras wild-type PC, nimotuzumab plus gemcitabine significantly improved OS and PFS with a good safety profile.",11/20/2023,JCO.22.02630,"{'Ruihua Xu': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: HenRui, BeiGene, AstraZeneca, Junshi Biosciences, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Serono, Roche, Astellas Pharma, KYM Biosciences'], 'Lin Shen': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: MSD, Bristol Myers Squib, AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Roche, Mingji Biopharmaceutical, Harbor BioMed, Merck, Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi', 'Research Funding: Nanjing Yaojieankang Biotechnology (Inst), Baiji Shenzhou (Beijing) Biotechnology (Inst), Beijing Xiantong Biomedical Technology (Inst), QiLu Pharmaceutical (Inst), Zaiding Pharmaceutical (Inst), Jacobio (Inst), CANbridge Pharmaceuticals (Inst)'], 'Xianhong Bai': ['Employment: Biotech Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd', 'Leadership: Biotech Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: Biotech Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd', 'Honoraria: Biotech Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Biotech Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd']}"

Immunotherapy may be synergistic with bevacizumab and chemotherapy.

Patients and Methods: ATALANTE/ENGOT-ov29 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02891824), a placebo-controlled double-blinded randomized phase III trial, enrolled patients with recurrent epithelial OC, one to two previous chemotherapy lines, and PFI >6 months. Eligible patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to atezolizumab (1,200 mg once every 3 weeks or equivalent) or placebo for up to 24 months, combined with bevacizumab and six cycles of chemotherapy doublet, stratified by PFI, PD-L1 status, and chemotherapy regimen. Coprimary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and PD-L1–positive populations (alpha .025 for each population).

Results: Between September 2016 and October 2019, 614 patients were randomly assigned: 410 to atezolizumab and 204 to placebo. Only 38% had PD-L1–positive tumors. After 3 years' median follow-up, the PFS difference between atezolizumab and placebo did not reach statistical significance in the ITT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99; P = .041; median 13.5 v 11.3 months, respectively) or PD-L1–positive (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.16; P = .30; median 15.2 v 13.1 months, respectively) populations. The immature overall survival (OS) HR was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.01; median 35.5 v 30.6 months with atezolizumab v placebo, respectively). Global health-related quality of life did not differ between treatment arms. Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 88% of atezolizumab-treated and 87% of placebo-treated patients; grade ≥3 AEs typical of immunotherapy were more common with atezolizumab (13% v 8%, respectively).

Conclusion: ATALANTE/ENGOT-ov29 did not meet its coprimary PFS objectives in the ITT or PD-L1–positive populations. OS follow-up continues.

Phase II Trial of Dabrafenib Plus Trametinib in Relapsed/Refractory BRAF V600–Mutant Pediatric High-Grade Glioma,Darren R.  Hargrave; Keita  Terashima; Junichi  Hara; Uwe R.  Kordes; Santhosh A.  Upadhyaya; Felix  Sahm; Eric  Bouffet; Roger J.  Packer; Olaf  Witt; Larissa  Sandalic; Agnieszka  Kieloch; Mark  Russo; Kenneth J.  Cohen; the Investigators involved in the high-grade glioma cohort,United Kingdom; Japan; Japan; Germany; TN; Germany; Germany; Germany; Canada; DC; Germany; Switzerland; Switzerland; NJ; MD,"Purpose: BRAF V600 mutation is detected in 5%-10% of pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs), and effective treatments are limited. In previous trials, dabrafenib as monotherapy or in combination with trametinib demonstrated activity in children and adults with relapsed/refractory BRAF V600–mutant HGG.

Methods: This phase II study evaluated dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with relapsed/refractory BRAF V600–mutant pHGG. The primary objective was overall response rate (ORR) by independent review by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. Secondary objectives included ORR by investigator determination, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), and safety.

Results: A total of 41 pediatric patients with previously treated BRAF V600–mutant HGG were enrolled. At primary analysis, median follow-up was 25.1 months, and 51% of patients remained on treatment. Sixteen of 20 discontinuations were due to progressive disease in this relapsed/refractory pHGG population. Independently assessed ORR was 56% (95% CI, 40 to 72). Median DOR was 22.2 months (95% CI, 7.6 months to not reached [NR]). Fourteen deaths were reported. Median OS was 32.8 months (95% CI, 19.2 months to NR). The most common all-cause adverse events (AEs) were pyrexia (51%), headache (34%), and dry skin (32%). Two patients (5%) had AEs (both rash) leading to discontinuation.

Conclusion: In relapsed/refractory BRAF V600–mutant pHGG, dabrafenib plus trametinib improved ORR versus previous trials of chemotherapy in molecularly unselected patients with pHGG and was associated with durable responses and encouraging survival. These findings suggest that dabrafenib plus trametinib is a promising targeted therapy option for children and adolescents with relapsed/refractory BRAF V600–mutant HGG.",11/20/2023,JCO.23.00558,{}
Effect of a Community Health Worker–Led Intervention Among Low-Income and Minoritized Patients With Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial,Manali I.  Patel; Kris  Kapphahn; Emily  Wood; Tumaini  Coker; Deborah  Salava; Angela  Riley; Ivana  Krajcinovic,CA; CA; CA; CA; WA; IL; IL; IL,"Purpose: To determine whether a community health worker (CHW)–led intervention could improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL; primary outcome) more than usual care among low-income and racial and ethnic minoritized populations newly diagnosed with cancer.

Methods: This randomized clinical trial was conducted from November 1, 2018, until August 31, 2021, in outpatient cancer clinics in Atlantic City, NJ, and Chicago, IL. Hourly low-wage worker members of an employer union health fund age 18 years or older with newly diagnosed solid tumor and hematologic malignancies were randomly assigned 1:1 to usual care (control group) or usual care augmented with a trained CHW for 12 months (intervention group). The CHW assisted participants with advance care planning (ACP), proactively screened symptoms, and referred participants to community-based resources for identified health-related social needs. Usual care comprised nurse case management and benefits redesign (waived copayments and free transportation for any cancer care received at preferred oncology clinics in each city). The primary outcome was HRQoL. Secondary outcomes included patient activation, satisfaction with decision, ACP documentation, health care use, total health care costs, and overall survival.

Results: A total of 160 participants were enrolled. Intervention group participants had a greater increase in mean HRQoL scores at 4-month and 12-month follow-up as compared with baseline than control group participants (expected mean difference, 11.25 [95% CI, 7.28 to 15.22]; 11.29 [95% CI, 6.96 to 15.62], respectively).

Conclusion: In this randomized trial, a CHW-led intervention significantly improved HRQoL for low-income and racial and ethnic minoritized patients with cancer more than usual care alone.",2/10/2024,JCO.23.00309,{}

No large-scale programs have been implemented to mitigate FT. We evaluated the effect of monthly FT screening as part of a larger patient-reported outcomes (PROs) digital monitoring intervention.

Methods: PRO-TECT (AFT-39) is a cluster-randomized trial of patients undergoing systemic therapy for metastatic cancer. Practices were randomly assigned 1:1 to digital symptom monitoring (PRO practices) or usual care (control practices). Digital monitoring consisted of between-visit online or automated telephone patient surveys about symptoms, functioning, and FT (single-item screening question from Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity) for up to 1 year, with automated alerts sent to practice nurses for concerning survey scores. Clinical team actions in response to alerts were not mandated. The primary outcome of this planned secondary analysis was development or worsening of financial difficulties, assessed via the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 financial difficulties measure, at any time compared with baseline. A randomly selected subset of patients and nurses were interviewed about their experiences with the intervention.

Results: One thousand one hundred ninety-one patients were enrolled (593 PRO; 598 control) at 52 US community oncology practices. Overall, 30.2% of patients treated at practices that received the FT screening intervention developed, or experienced worsening of, financial difficulties, compared with 39.0% treated at control practices (P = .004). Patients and nurses interviewed stated that FT screening identified patients for financial counseling who otherwise would be reluctant to seek, or unaware of the availability of, assistance.

Conclusion: In this report of a secondary outcome from a randomized clinical trial, FT screening as part of routine digital patient monitoring with PROs reduced the development, or worsening, of financial difficulties among patients undergoing systemic cancer therapy.",10/10/2023,JCO.22.02834,{}

Patients and Methods: This study is a post-trial follow-up of the ASTRRA trial, involving 1,483 premenopausal women younger than 45 years treated with definitive surgery after completing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to complete 5 years of tamoxifen (TAM) alone (TAM-only) or 5 years of TAM with ovarian function suppression (OFS) for 2 years (TAM + OFS). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary end point was overall survival (OS).

Results: At 106.4 months of median follow-up, there was a continuous significant reduction in the DFS event rate in the TAM + OFS group. The 8-year DFS rate was 85.4% in the TAM + OFS group and 80.2% in the TAM-only group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.87). There were no significant differences in OS between the two groups. The OS rate was 96.5% in the TAM + OFS group and 95.3% in the TAM-only group (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.25).

Conclusion: Adding OFS for 2 years to adjuvant TAM with a longer follow-up resulted in consistent DFS benefits, suggesting that adding OFS to TAM should be considered for patients who remain in a premenopausal state or resume ovarian function after chemotherapy.",11/1/2023,JCO.23.00557,"{'Soo Yeon Baek': ['Honoraria: Takeda', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Gencurix'], 'Jai Min Ryu': ['Honoraria: Intuitive Surgical', 'Research Funding: Medtronic'], 'Seung Il Kim': ['Research Funding: Syantra'], 'Seock-Ah Im': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AstraZeneca, Novartis, Roche/Genentech, Eisai, Pfizer, Amgen, Hanmi, Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, MSD, Daiichi Sankyo', 'Research Funding: AstraZeneca (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), Roche/Genentech (Inst), Daewoong Pharmaceutical (Inst), Eisai (Inst), Boryung Pharmaceuticals (Inst)', 'Other Relationship: Roche'], 'Kyong Hwa Park': ['Honoraria: Celltrion'], 'Joon Jeong': ['Honoraria: Bixink, Pfizer, Zeiss, Gencurix, Lilly, Amgen, Roche, MSD, Alvogen Korea, Medtronic, Boryung Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, Eisai, Hanmi, Takeda, Celltrion', 'Research Funding: Celltrion, Yuhan'], 'Hee Jeong Kim': ['Honoraria: Alvogen Korea, Takeda']}"

Methods: This single-arm phase II clinical trial enrolled patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC with untreated brain metastases without neurologic symptoms or asymptomatic with medical treatment. Dexamethasone was allowed up to 4 mg once daily. Atezolizumab plus carboplatin and pemetrexed was given for four to six cycles followed by atezolizumab plus pemetrexed until progression for a maximum of 2 years. The primary end points were to determine the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 12 weeks and the incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events during the first 9 weeks. Intracranial outcomes were assessed using response assessment in neuro-oncology brain metastases criteria.

Results: Forty patients were enrolled and 22 (55%) were receiving corticosteroids at baseline. The overall 12-week PFS rate was 62.2% (95% credibility interval [CrI], 47.1 to 76.2). The rate of grade 3/4 adverse events during the first 9 weeks was 27.5%. Most neurologic events were grade 1 and 2 but five patients (12.5%) experienced grade 3-4 neurologic events. With a median follow-up of 31 months, intracranial median PFS was 6.9 months and response rate was 42.7% (95% CrI, 28.1 to 57.9).

SAKK 06/17 investigated the addition of neoadjuvant durvalumab to gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy followed by radical surgery and adjuvant checkpoint inhibition with durvalumab.

Patients and Methods: SAKK 06/17 was an investigator-initiated, open-label, single-arm phase II study including cisplatin-fit patients with stage cT2-T4a cN0-1 operable MIUC. Four cycles of neoadjuvant GC in combination with four cycles of durvalumab (start with GC cycle 2) were administered, followed by radical surgery. Adjuvant durvalumab was given for 10 cycles. The primary end point was event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years.

Results: Sixty one patients were accrued at 12 sites. The full analysis set consisted of 57 patients, 54 (95%) had bladder cancer. Median follow-up was 40 months. The primary end point was met, with EFS at 2 years of 76% (one-sided 90% CI [lower bound], 67%; two-sided 95% CI, 62 to 85). EFS at 3 years was 73% (95% CI, 59 to 83). Complete pathologic response in resected patients (N = 52) was achieved in 17 patients (33%), and 31 (60%) had pathologic response <ypT2 ypN0. Overall survival (OS) was 85% (95% CI, 72 to 92) at 2 years and 81% (95% CI, 67 to 89) at 3 years. Grade 3 and 4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) during neoadjuvant treatment occurred in 42% and 25%, respectively. TRAEs related to adjuvant durvalumab were grade 3 in 5 (11%) and grade 4 in 2 (4%) patients.

Chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal cancer: phase III randomized Intergroup study 0099.,M  Al-Sarraf; M  LeBlanc; P G  Giri; K K  Fu; J  Cooper; T  Vuong; A A  Forastiere; G  Adams; W A  Sakr; D E  Schuller; J F  Ensley,,"Purpose: The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) coordinated an Intergroup study with the participation of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). This randomized phase III trial compared chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in patients with nasopharyngeal cancers.

Materials and Methods: Radiotherapy was administered in both arms: 1.8- to 2.0-Gy/d fractions Monday to Friday for 35 to 39 fractions for a total dose of 70 Gy. The investigational arm received chemotherapy with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22, and 43 during radiotherapy; postradiotherapy, chemotherapy with cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 1 and fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 4 was administered every 4 weeks for three courses. Patients were stratified by tumor stage, nodal stage, performance status, and histology.

Results: Of 193 patients registered, 147 (69 radiotherapy and 78 chemoradiotherapy) were eligible for primary analysis for survival and toxicity. The median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 15 months for eligible patients on the radiotherapy arm and was not reached for the chemo-radiotherapy group. The 3-year PFS rate was 24% versus 69%, respectively (P < .001). The median survival time was 34 months for the radiotherapy group and not reached for the chemo-radiotherapy group, and the 3-year survival rate was 47% versus 78%, respectively (P = .005). One hundred eighty-five patients were included in a secondary analysis for survival. The 3-year survival rate for patients randomized to radiotherapy was 46%, and for the chemoradiotherapy group was 76% (P < .001).

Conclusion: We conclude that chemoradiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy alone for patients with advanced nasopharyngeal cancers with respect to PFS and overall survival.",8/20/2023,JCO.22.02764,{}
Randomized Phase II Multicenter Trial of Abiraterone Acetate With or Without Cabazitaxel in the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer,Susan F.  Slovin; Karen  Knudsen; Susan  Halabi; Renee  de Leeuw; Ayesha  Shafi; Praneet  Kang; Steven  Wolf; Bin  Luo; Anuradha  Gopalan; Tracy  Curley; Mark  Fleming; Ana  Molina; Celina  Fernandez; Kevin  Kelly,NY; PA; NC; PA; PA; NY; NC; NC; NY; NY; VA; NY; NY; PA,"Purpose: Improving clinical outcomes with novel drug combinations to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is challenging. Preclinical studies showed cabazitaxel had superior antitumor efficacy compared with docetaxel. Gene expression profiling revealed divergent effects of these taxanes in cycling cells. mCRPC are RB deficient rendering them hypersensitive to taxanes. These data suggested that upfront treatment with cabazitaxel with abiraterone may affect therapeutic response. We designed a phase II randomized noncomparative trial of abiraterone acetate/prednisone (AAP) or AAP and cabazitaxel (AAP + C) in men with mCRPC to address this hypothesis.

Methods: This trial of 81 men with mCRPC determined the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival, overall objective response, and safety of AAP or AAP + C. Equally allocated patients received AAP followed by switching to cabazitaxel upon radiographic progression (arm 1) or upfront with AAP + C (arm 2). Patients were stratified into high-/low-risk groups by the Halabi nomogram. Real-time assessment of RB status and circulating tumor cell (CTC) analysis to correlate with clinical outcomes was exploratory.

Results: Both treatment arms were well-tolerated. Median rPFS in AAP was 6.4 months (95% CI, 3.8 to 10.6) and median overall survival (OS) 18.3 months (95% CI, 14.4 to 37.6), respectively. Fifty-six percent of patients showed ≥50% decline in PSA. Median rPFS in AAP + C was 14.8 months (95% CI, 10.6 to 16.4), and median OS 24.5 months (95% CI, 20.4 to 35.0). There was a ≥50% decline in PSA in 92.1% of men. Neither RB expression in pretherapy tumor biopsy, CTC, or tissue explants identified those who may benefit from AAP + C.

Conclusion: AAP + C was safe with improved rPFS, OS duration, and a higher proportion of PSA declines. This suggests that AAP + C given earlier rather than sequentially may benefit some men. Further work is needed to identify this population.",11/10/2023,JCO.22.02639,"{'Susan F.

In contrast to cytotoxic chemotherapy, CDK4/6 inhibitors are given at a fixed dose, irrespective of BMI or weight. This preplanned analysis of the global randomized PALLAS trial investigates the impact of BMI on the side-effect profile, treatment adherence, and efficacy of palbociclib.

Methods: Patients were categorized at baseline according to WHO BMI categories. Neutropenia rates were assessed with univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Time to early discontinuation of palbociclib was analyzed with Fine and Gray competing risk models. Unstratified Cox models were used to investigate the association between BMI category and time to invasive disease-free survival (iDFS). 95% CIs were derived.

Results: Of 5,698 patients included in this analysis, 68 (1.2%) were underweight, 2,082 (36.5%) normal weight, 1,818 (31.9%) overweight, and 1,730 (30.4%) obese at baseline. In the palbociclib arm, higher BMI was associated with a significant decrease in neutropenia (unadjusted odds ratio for 1-unit change, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.94; adjusted for age, race ethnicity, region, chemotherapy use, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group at baseline, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.95). This translated into a significant decrease in treatment discontinuation rate with higher BMI (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for 10-unit change, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.83). There was no significant improvement in iDFS with the addition of palbociclib to ET in any weight category (normal weight HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.12; overweight HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.49; and obese HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.30) in this analysis early in follow-up (31 months).

Conclusion: This preplanned analysis of the PALLAS trial demonstrates a significant impact of BMI on side effects, dose reductions, early treatment discontinuation, and relative dose intensity. Additional long-term follow-up will further evaluate whether BMI ultimately affects outcome.",11/20/2023,JCO.23.00126,"{'Georg Pfeiler': ['Honoraria: Amgen, Roche/Genentech, Pfizer, Lilly, AstraZeneca/Merck, AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo, Novartis, UCB, Accord Healthcare, Seagen, Gilead Sciences', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Pfizer, Amgen, Lilly, Novartis, AstraZeneca/Merck, AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo, UCB, Roche/Genentech, Gilead Sciences, Seagen', ""Speakers' Bureau: Roche/Genentech, Pfizer, Lilly, Novartis, UCB, AstraZeneca/Merck, AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo, Accord Healthcare, Amgen, Seagen, Gilead Sciences"", 'Research Funding: Accord Healthcare, Pfizer, Roche/Genentech, AstraZeneca (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Novartis, Lilly, Roche/Genentech, AstraZeneca/Daiichi Sankyo, Gilead Sciences, Seagen'], 'Dominik Hlauschek': ['Research Funding: Amgen (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Roche (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Sandoz (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Artera (Inst), Daiichi Sankyo (Inst), OncoMark (Inst), Cepheid (Inst)'], 'Erica L.

Patients and Methods: PANDA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02904031) was an open-label, randomized phase II noncomparative trial in previously untreated patients age 70 years and older with unresectable RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to mFOLFOX + PAN (arm A) or 5-FU + LV + PAN (arm B) for up to 12 cycles, followed by PAN maintenance. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). In each arm, assuming a null hypothesis of median PFS time ≤6 months and target PFS ≥9.65, 90 patients per arm were needed to achieve 90% power and 5% type I error (one-sided Brookmeyer-Crowley test).

Results: Between July 2016 and April 2019, 91 patients were randomly assigned to arm A and 92 to arm B. At a median follow-up of 50.0 months (IQR, 45.6-56.4), median PFS was 9.6 and 9.0 months for arm A and B, respectively (P < .001 in each arm). Overall response rate was 69% and 52%, whereas median overall survival was 23.5 and 22.0 months in arm A and B, respectively. The overall rate of grade >2 chemotherapy-related adverse events was 60% and 37%, respectively. Baseline G8 and Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients scores were prognostic, but they were not associated with efficacy and safety of the two arms.

Conclusion: Both mFOLFOX and 5-FU + LV + PAN are reasonable options as initial therapy of elderly patients with RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC. 5-FU + LV + PAN is associated with a better safety profile.",12/1/2023,JCO.23.00506,{}

However, the efficacy and safety of HHT-based induction therapy have not been confirmed for childhood AML, and ATRA-based treatment has not been evaluated among patients with non-APL AML.

Patients and Methods: This open-label, multicenter, randomized Chinese Children's Leukemia Group-AML 2015 study was performed across 35 centers in China. Patients with newly diagnosed childhood AML were first randomly assigned to receive an HHT-based (H arm) or etoposide-based (E arm) induction regimen and then randomly allocated to receive cytarabine-based (AC arm) or ATRA-based (AT arm) maintenance therapy. The primary end points were the complete remission (CR) rate after induction therapy, and the secondary end points were the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) at 3 years.

Results: We enrolled 1,258 patients, of whom 1,253 were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. The overall CR rate was significantly higher in the H arm than in the E arm (79.9% v 73.9%, P = .014). According to the intention-to-treat analysis, the 3-year OS was 69.2% (95% CI, 65.1 to 72.9) in the H arm and 62.8% (95% CI, 58.7 to 66.6) in the E arm (P = .025); the 3-year EFS was 61.1% (95% CI, 56.8 to 65.0) in the H arm and 53.4% (95% CI, 49.2 to 57.3) in the E arm (P = .022). Among the per-protocol population, who received maintenance therapy, the 3-year EFS did not differ significantly across the four arms (H + AT arm: 70.7%, 95% CI, 61.1 to 78.3; H + AC arm: 74.8%, 95% CI, 67.0 to 81.0, P = .933; E + AC arm: 72.9%, 95% CI, 65.1 to 79.2, P = .789; E + AT arm: 66.2%, 95% CI, 56.8 to 74.0, P = .336).

Conclusion: HHT is an alternative combination regimen for childhood AML. The effects of ATRA-based maintenance are comparable with those of cytarabine-based maintenance therapy.",11/1/2023,JCO.22.02836,{}

ROSEWOOD is a phase II, randomized study that assessed the efficacy and safety of ZO versus obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL).

Methods: Patients with R/R FL who had received ≥2 lines of therapy, including an anti-CD20 antibody and an alkylating agent, were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive ZO or obinutuzumab (O). The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR) by independent central review (ICR). Secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and safety.

Results: A total of 217 patients were randomized (ZO, 145; O, 72). Median study follow-up was 20.2 months. The study met its primary end point: ORR by ICR was 69% (ZO) versus 46% (O; P = .001). Complete response rate was 39% (ZO) versus 19% (O); 18-month DOR rate was 69% (ZO) versus 42% (O). Median PFS was 28.0 months (ZO) versus 10.4 months (O; hazard ratio, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.75]; P < .001). The most common adverse events with ZO were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, and fatigue; incidences of atrial fibrillation and major hemorrhage were 3% and 1%, respectively.

Conclusion: The combination of ZO met its primary end point of a superior ORR versus O, and demonstrated meaningful activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with R/R FL. ZO had a favorable benefit-risk profile compared with O, and represents a potential combination therapy for patients with R/R FL.",11/20/2023,JCO.23.00775,"{'Pier Luigi Zinzani': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Celltrion, Gilead Sciences, Janssen-Cilag, Bristol Myers Squibb, SERVIER, Sandoz, MSD, Roche, EUSA Pharma, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Takeda, Secura BIO, TG Therapeutics, Novartis, ADC Therapeutics, Incyte, BeiGene', ""Speakers' Bureau: MSD, EUSA Pharma, Novartis""], 'Jiří Mayer': ['Research Funding: BeiGene'], 'Christopher R.

As previously reported, COMBO450 improved progression-free survival (PFS) versus vemurafenib (part 1 primary end point) and ENCO300 (part 1 key secondary end point; not statistically significant). Part 2, requested by the US Food and Drug Administration, evaluated the contribution of binimetinib by maintaining the same encorafenib dosage in the combination (encorafenib 300 mg once daily plus binimetinib 45 mg twice daily [COMBO300]) and ENCO300 arms.

Methods: In part 2, patients were randomly assigned 3:1 to COMBO300 or ENCO300. ENCO300 (parts 1 and 2) data were combined, per protocol, for PFS analysis (key secondary end point) by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). Other analyses included overall response rate (ORR), overall survival, and safety.

Results: Two hundred fifty-eight patients received COMBO300, and 86 received ENCO300. Per protocol, ENCO300 arms (parts 1 and 2 combined) were also evaluated (n = 280). The median follow-up for ENCO300 was 40.8 months (part 1) and 57.1 months (part 2). The median PFS (95% CI) was 12.9 months (10.9 to 14.9) for COMBO300 versus 9.2  months (7.4 to 11.1) for ENCO300 (parts 1  and  2) and 7.4  months (5.6 to 9.2) for ENCO300 (part 2). The hazard ratio (95% CI) for COMBO300 was 0.74 (0.60 to 0.92; two-sided P = .003) versus ENCO300 (parts 1  and  2). The ORR by BIRC (95% CI) was 68% (62 to 74) and 51% (45 to 57) for COMBO300 and ENCO300 (parts 1  and  2), respectively. COMBO300 had greater relative dose intensity and fewer grade 3/4 adverse events than ENCO300.

Conclusion: COMBO300 improved PFS, ORR, and tolerability compared with ENCO300, confirming the contribution of binimetinib to efficacy and safety.",10/10/2023,JCO.22.02322,{}

We assessed the activity of atezolizumab (anti–PD-L1) in patients with advanced penile cancer, with or without radiotherapy (RT).

Patients and Methods: A single-center, nonrandomized phase II study with two treatment arms was conducted in 32 patients with histologically confirmed advanced penile cancer. All patients received atezolizumab (1,200 mg) once every 3 weeks. Twenty patients, who were expected to benefit from RT for locoregional disease control, received additional irradiation. The primary end point was 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) for the complete cohort and was reached if the actual 1-year PFS was at least 35%. Secondary end points included OS, objective response rate (ORR), and tolerability. Exploratory biomarker analyses were conducted in pretreatment specimens.

Results: Median follow-up was 29.1 months (IQR, 18.1-33.5). Grade 3-4 adverse events related to atezolizumab or RT were observed in 3/32 (9.4%) and 13/20 (65%) patients, respectively. One-year PFS was 12.5% (95% CI, 5.0 to 31.3), which did not meet the study's primary end point. Median OS was 11.3 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 18.7). In the objective response-evaluable population (n = 30; 93.8%), the ORR was 16.7% (95% CI, 6 to 35), including 2 (6.7%) complete responders and 3 (10%) partial responders. Improved PFS was observed in patients with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)–positive tumors (P = .003) and those with high infiltration of intratumoral CD3+CD8+ T cells (P = .037).

Conclusion: Although the primary end point of 1-year PFS was not met, durable antitumor activity to atezolizumab was observed in a subset of patients. Biomarkers, such as hrHPV and intratumoral CD3+CD8+ T-cell infiltration, may help to better select responders.",11/1/2023,JCO.22.02894,"{'Floris J.

Implementation strategies directed at patients, clinicians, or both may increase tobacco use treatment (TUT) within oncology.

Methods: We conducted a four-arm cluster-randomized pragmatic trial across 11 clinical sites comparing the effect of strategies informed by behavioral economics on TUT engagement during oncology encounters with cancer patients. We delivered electronic health record (EHR)–based nudges promoting TUT across four nudge conditions: patient only, clinician only, patient and clinician, or usual care. Nudges were designed to counteract cognitive biases that reduce TUT engagement. The primary outcome was TUT penetration, defined as the proportion of patients with documented TUT referral or a medication prescription in the EHR. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the parameters of a linear model.

Results: From June 2021 to July 2022, we randomly assigned 246 clinicians in 95 clusters, and collected TUT penetration data from their encounters with 2,146 eligible patients who smoke receiving oncologic care. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed that the clinician nudge led to a significant increase in TUT penetration versus usual care (35.6% v 13.5%; OR = 3.64; 95% CI, 2.52 to 5.24; P < .0001). Completer-only analysis (N = 1,795) showed similar impact (37.7% clinician nudge v 13.5% usual care; OR = 3.77; 95% CI, 2.73 to 5.19; P < .0001). Clinician type affected TUT penetration, with physicians less likely to provide TUT than advanced practice providers (ITT OR = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.88; P = .004).

Conclusion: EHR nudges, informed by behavioral economics and aimed at oncology clinicians, appear to substantially increase TUT penetration.

Patients and Methods: Patients with MCRC were randomly assigned, in a 2 × 2 factorial design, to XELOX versus FOLFOX-4, and then to bevacizumab versus placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS).

Results: A total of 1,401 patients were randomly assigned in this 2 × 2 analysis. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.4 months in the bevacizumab group and 8.0 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 97.5% CI, 0.72 to 0.95; P = .0023). Median overall survival was 21.3 months in the bevacizumab group and 19.9 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.89; 97.5% CI, 0.76 to 1.03; P = .077). Response rates were similar in both arms. Analysis of treatment withdrawals showed that, despite protocol allowance of treatment continuation until disease progression, only 29% and 47% of bevacizumab and placebo recipients, respectively, were treated until progression. The toxicity profile of bevacizumab was consistent with that documented in previous trials.

Conclusion: The addition of bevacizumab to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improved PFS in this first-line trial in patients with MCRC. Overall survival differences did not reach statistical significance, and response rate was not improved by the addition of bevacizumab. Treatment continuation until disease progression may be necessary in order to optimize the contribution of bevacizumab to therapy.",7/20/2023,JCO.22.02760,{}

BensonIII,IL; IL; IL; IL; IL; IL; IL; IL,"Purpose: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Antiangiogenic therapy with bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy improves survival in previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. This study was conducted to determine the effect of bevacizumab (at 10 mg/kg) on survival duration for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer.

Patients and Methods: Eight hundred twenty-nine metastatic colorectal cancer patients previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine and irinotecan were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX4) with bevacizumab; FOLFOX4 without bevacizumab; or bevacizumab alone. The primary end point was overall survival, with additional determinations of progression-free survival, response, and toxicity.

Results: The median duration of survival for the group treated with FOLFOX4 and bevacizumab was 12.9 months compared with 10.8 months for the group treated with FOLFOX4 alone (corresponding hazard ratio for death = 0.75; P = .0011), and 10.2 months for those treated with bevacizumab alone. The median progression-free survival for the group treated with FOLFOX4 in combination with bevacizumab was 7.3 months, compared with 4.7 months for the group treated with FOLFOX4 alone (corresponding hazard ratio for progression = 0.61; P < .0001), and 2.7 months for those treated with bevacizumab alone. The corresponding overall response rates were 22.7%, 8.6%, and 3.3%, respectively (P < .0001 for FOLFOX4 with bevacizumab v FOLFOX4 comparison). Bevacizumab was associated with hypertension, bleeding, and vomiting.

Conclusion: The addition of bevacizumab to oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin improves survival duration for patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer.",7/20/2023,JCO.22.02761,{}

This phase III study investigated two sequences: folinic acid, FU, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) followed by folinic acid, FU, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX6; arm A), and FOLFOX6 followed by FOLFIRI (arm B).

Patients and Methods: Previously untreated patients with assessable disease were randomly assigned to receive a 2-hour infusion of l-LV 200 mg/m2 or dl-LV 400 mg/m2 followed by a FU bolus 400 mg/m2 and 46-hour infusion 2,400 to 3,000 mg/m2 every 46 hours every 2 weeks, either with irinotecan 180 mg/m2 or with oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion on day 1. At progression, irinotecan was replaced by oxaliplatin (arm A), or oxaliplatin by irinotecan (arm B).

Results: Median survival was 21.5 months in 109 patients allocated to FOLFIRI then FOLFOX6 versus 20.6 months in 111 patients allocated to FOLFOX6 then FOLFIRI (P = .99). Median second progression-free survival (PFS) was 14.2 months in arm A versus 10.9 in arm B (P = .64). In first-line therapy, FOLFIRI achieved 56% response rate (RR) and 8.5 months median PFS, versus FOLFOX6 which achieved 54% RR and 8.0 months median PFS (P = .26). Second-line FOLFIRI achieved 4% RR and 2.5 months median PFS, versus FOLFOX6 which achieved 15% RR and 4.2 months PFS. In first-line therapy, National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3/4 mucositis, nausea/vomiting, and grade 2 alopecia were more frequent with FOLFIRI, and grade 3/4 neutropenia and neurosensory toxicity were more frequent with FOLFOX6.

Alberts,Canada.; Canada.; Canada.; Canada.; Canada.; Canada.; Canada.; Canada.; Canada.,"Purpose: Three agents with differing mechanisms of action are available for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer: fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. In this study, we compared the activity and toxicity of three different two-drug combinations in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had not been treated previously for advanced disease.

Patients and Methods: Patients were concurrently randomly assigned to receive irinotecan and bolus fluorouracil plus leucovorin (IFL, control combination), oxaliplatin and infused fluorouracil plus leucovorin (FOLFOX), or irinotecan and oxaliplatin (IROX). The primary end point was time to progression, with secondary end points of response rate, survival time, and toxicity.

Results: A total of 795 patients were randomly assigned between May 1999 and April 2001. A median time to progression of 8.7 months, response rate of 45%, and median survival time of 19.5 months were observed for FOLFOX. These results were significantly superior to those observed for IFL for all end points (6.9 months, 31%, and 15.0 months, respectively) or for IROX (6.5 months, 35%, and 17.4 months, respectively) for time to progression and response. The FOLFOX regimen had significantly lower rates of severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, and dehydration. Sensory neuropathy and neutropenia were more common with the regimens containing oxaliplatin.

Conclusion: The FOLFOX regimen of oxaliplatin and infused fluorouracil plus leucovorin was active and comparatively safe. It should be considered as a standard therapy for patients with advanced colorectal cancer.",7/1/2023,JCO.22.02759,{}

This global, phase III study (LASER301) compared lazertinib versus gefitinib in treatment-naïve patients with EGFR-mutated (exon 19 deletion [ex19del]/L858R) locally advanced or metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Patients and Methods: Patients were 18 years and older with no previous systemic anticancer therapy. Neurologically stable patients with CNS metastases were allowed. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to lazertinib 240 mg once daily orally or gefitinib 250 mg once daily orally, stratified by mutation status and race. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST v1.1.

Results: Overall, 393 patients received double-blind study treatment across 96 sites in 13 countries. Median PFS was significantly longer with lazertinib than with gefitinib (20.6 v 9.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.58; P < .001). The PFS benefit of lazertinib over gefitinib was consistent across all predefined subgroups. The objective response rate was 76% in both groups (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.59). Median duration of response was 19.4 months (95% CI, 16.6 to 24.9) with lazertinib versus 8.3 months (95% CI, 6.9 to 10.9) with gefitinib. Overall survival data were immature at the interim analysis (29% maturity). The 18-month survival rate was 80% with lazertinib and 72% with gefitinib (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.08; P = .116). Observed safety of both treatments was consistent with their previously reported safety profiles.

We investigated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of gilteritinib incorporated into intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy, and as maintenance therapy for adult patients with newly diagnosed, non–favorable-risk AML.

Methods: In this phase IB study (2215-CL-0103; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02236013), 103 participants were screened and 80 were allocated to treatment. The study was divided into four parts: dose escalation, dose expansion, investigation of alternate anthracycline and gilteritinib schedule, and continuous gilteritinib during consolidation.

Results: After dose escalation, 120 mg gilteritinib once daily was chosen for further study. There were 58 participants evaluable for response at this dose, 36 of whom harbored FLT3 mutations. For participants with FLT3-mutated AML, the composite complete response (CRc) rate was 89% (83% were conventional complete responses), all achieved after a single induction cycle. The median overall survival time was 46.1 months. Gilteritinib was well-tolerated in this context although the median time to count recovery during induction was approximately 40 days. Longer time-to-count recovery was associated with higher trough levels of gilteritinib, which, in turn, were associated with azole use. The recommended regimen is gilteritinib at a dose of 120 mg once daily from days 4 to 17 or 8 to 21 of a 7 + 3 induction with either idarubicin or daunorubicin and from day 1 continuously with high-dose cytarabine consolidation. Maintenance therapy with gilteritinib was well-tolerated.

Conclusion: These results demonstrated the safety and tolerability of gilteritinib incorporated into an induction and consolidation chemotherapy regimen, and as single-agent maintenance therapy for patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutant AML. The data herein provide an important framework for the design of randomized trials comparing gilteritinib with other FLT3 inhibitors.",9/10/2023,JCO.22.02721,"{'Angela J.

Enfortumab vedotin (EV) and pembrolizumab (Pembro) individually have shown a survival benefit in urothelial cancer in second-line + la/mUC settings. Here, we present data from the pivotal trial of EV plus Pembro (EV + Pembro) in the 1L setting.

Patients and Methods: In Cohort K of the EV-103 phase Ib/II study, cisplatin-ineligible patients with previously untreated la/mUC were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive EV as monotherapy or in combination with Pembro. The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (cORR) per blinded independent central review. Secondary end points included duration of response (DOR) and safety. There were no formal statistical comparisons between treatment arms.

Results: The cORR was 64.5% (95% CI, 52.7 to 75.1) and 45.2% (95% CI, 33.5 to 57.3) for patients treated with EV + Pembro (N = 76) and EV monotherapy (N = 73), respectively. The median DOR was not reached for the combination and was 13.2 months for monotherapy; 65.4% and 56.3% of patients who responded to the combination and monotherapy, respectively, maintained a response at 12 months. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in patients treated with the combination were maculopapular rash (17.1%), fatigue (9.2%), and neutropenia (9.2%). EV TRAEs of special interest (any grade) in the combination arm included skin reactions (67.1%) and peripheral neuropathy (60.5%).

Conclusion: EV + Pembro showed a high cORR with durable responses as 1L treatment in cisplatin-ineligible patients with la/mUC. Patients who received EV monotherapy had a response and safety profile consistent with previous studies. Adverse events for EV + Pembro were manageable, with no new safety signals observed.",9/1/2023,JCO.22.02887,{}
"Relacorilant + Nab-Paclitaxel in Patients With Recurrent, Platinum-Resistant Ovarian Cancer: A Three-Arm, Randomized, Controlled, Open-Label Phase II Study",Nicoletta  Colombo; Toon  Van Gorp; Ursula A.

Tudor; Domenica  Lorusso,Italy; Italy; Belgium; MA; Spain; NY; IL; PA; CA; CA; CA; CA; CA; Italy,"Purpose: Despite therapeutic advances, outcomes for patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer remain poor. Selective glucocorticoid receptor modulation with relacorilant may restore chemosensitivity and enhance chemotherapy efficacy.

Methods: This three-arm, randomized, controlled, open-label phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03776812) enrolled women with recurrent, platinum-resistant/refractory, high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, or ovarian carcinosarcoma treated with ≤4 prior chemotherapeutic regimens. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to (1) nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) + intermittent relacorilant (150 mg the day before, of, and after nab-paclitaxel); (2) nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) + continuous relacorilant (100 mg once daily); or (3) nab-paclitaxel monotherapy (100 mg/m2). Nab-paclitaxel was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment; objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), and safety were secondary end points.

Results: A total of 178 women were randomly assigned. Intermittent relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; log-rank test P = .038; median follow-up, 11.1 months) and DOR (HR, 0.36; P = .006) versus nab-paclitaxel monotherapy, while ORR was similar across arms. At the preplanned OS analysis (median follow-up, 22.5 months), the OS HR was 0.67 (P = .066) for the intermittent arm versus nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. Continuous relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel showed numerically improved median PFS but did not result in significant improvement over nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. Adverse events were comparable across study arms, with neutropenia, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and fatigue/asthenia being the most common grade ≥3 adverse events.

Conclusion: Intermittent relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel improved PFS, DOR, and OS compared with nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. On the basis of protocol-prespecified Hochberg step-up multiplicity adjustment, the primary end point did not reach statistical significance (P < .025). A phase III evaluation of this regimen is underway (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05257408).",10/20/2023,JCO.22.02624,{}
FOLFOXIRI Plus Cetuximab or Bevacizumab as First-Line Treatment of BRAFV600E-Mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: The Randomized Phase II FIRE-4.5 (AIO KRK0116) Study,Sebastian  Stintzing; Kathrin  Heinrich; David  Tougeron; Dominik Paul  Modest; Ingo  Schwaner; Jan  Eucker; Rudolf  Pihusch; Martina  Stauch; Florian  Kaiser; Christoph  Kahl; Meinolf  Karthaus; Christian  Müller; Christof  Burkart; Anke  Reinacher-Schick; Stefan  Kasper-Virchow; Ludwig  Fischer von Weikersthal; Beate  Krammer-Steiner; Gerald Wolfgang  Prager; Julien  Taieb; Volker  Heinemann,Germany; Germany; Germany; France; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Germany; Austria; France; France; Germany; France,"Purpose: BRAFV600E mutation is associated with a poor outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This clinical trial investigated the efficacy of triplet chemotherapy (fluorouracil, folinic acid, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) combined with either cetuximab or bevacizumab in patients with previously untreated BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC.

Patients and Methods: In this controlled, randomized, open-label phase II trial, 109 patients were randomly assigned, 107 of whom were included into the full analysis set (FAS). Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab in the experimental arm (n = 72) or FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab in the control arm (n = 35). The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1., evaluated in patients treated according to protocol (ATP population). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and feasibility were analyzed as secondary end points.

Results: Eighteen patients discontinued study treatment before the first tumor assessment, thus resulting in the ATP population of 89 patients. In these patients, ORR was 51% (30/59) in the cetuximab-based experimental arm and 67% (20/30) in the bevacizumab-based control arm (odds ratio, 1.93; 80% CI, 1.06 to 3.52; P = .92 [one-sided]). In the full analysis set, median PFS was significantly inferior in the experimental arm (6.7 months v 10.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.89; P = .006). Median OS analyzed at an event rate of 64.5% showed a trend toward shorter survival in cetuximab-treated patients (12.9 months v 17.1 months; HR, 1.4; P = .20).

Conclusion: To our knowledge, FIRE-4.5 is the first prospective and randomized study investigating first-line treatment of BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC. FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab does not induce a higher ORR when compared with FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab in first-line treatment of BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC. Bevacizumab-based chemotherapy remains the preferable first-line treatment of patients with BRAFV600E-mutant mCRC.",9/1/2023,JCO.22.01420,{}

Patients and Methods: In AMEERA-3 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04059484), an open-label, worldwide phase II trial, patients with ER+/HER2– aBC who progressed in the (neo)adjuvant or advanced settings after not more than two previous lines of endocrine therapy (ET) were randomly assigned 1:1 to amcenestrant or single-agent endocrine treatment of physician's choice (TPC), stratified by the presence/absence of visceral metastases, previous/no treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0/1). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by independent central review, compared using a stratified log-rank test (one-sided type I error rate of 2.5%).

Results: Between October 22, 2019, and February 15, 2021, 290 patients were randomly assigned to amcenestrant (n = 143) or TPC (n = 147). PFS was numerically similar between amcenestrant and TPC (median PFS [mPFS], 3.6 v 3.7 months; stratified hazard ratio [HR], 1.051 [95% CI, 0.789 to 1.4]; one-sided P = .643). Among patients with baseline mutated ESR1; (n = 120 of 280), amcenestrant numerically prolonged PFS versus TPC (mPFS, 3.7 v 2.0 months; stratified HR, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.565 to 1.435]). Overall survival data were immature but numerically similar between groups (HR, 0.913; 95% CI, 0.595 to 1.403). In amcenestrant versus TPC groups, treatment-emergent adverse events (any grade) occurred in 82.5% versus 76.2% of patients and grade ≥3 events occurred in 21.7% versus 15.6%.

Conclusion: AMEERA-3 did not meet its primary objective of improved PFS with amcenestrant versus TPC although a numerical improvement in PFS was observed in patients with baseline ESR1 mutation.

We aimed to compare outcomes of the BuFlu regimen with those of the BuCy regimen in HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT).

Methods: We performed an open-label, randomized phase III trial at 12 hospitals in China. Eligible patients with AML (18-65 years) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive BuFlu (busulfan 0.8 mg/kg four times per day on days –6 to –3; fludarabine 30 mg/m2 once daily on days –7 to –3) or BuCy (same dose of busulfan; cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg once daily on days –3 and –2). The primary end point was 1-year TRM in the intention-to-treat population and safety in the per-protocol population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02487069) and is complete.

Results: From November 20, 2015, to September 30, 2019, 386 patients were randomly assigned to receive the BuFlu (n = 194) or BuCy (n = 192) regimen. The median follow-up was 55.0 (IQR, 46.5-69.0) months after random assignment. The 1-year TRM was 7.2% (95% CI, 4.1 to 11.4) and 14.1% (95% CI, 9.6 to 19.4; hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.97; P = .041), the 5-year relapse was 17.9% (95% CI, 9.6 to 28.3) and 14.2% (95% CI, 9.1 to 20.5; HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.95; P = .670), and the 5-year overall survival was 72.5% (95% CI, 62.2 to 80.4) and 68.2% (95% CI, 58.9 to 75.9; HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.26; P = .465) in two groups, respectively. Grade 3 regimen-related toxicity (RRT) was reported for 0 of 191 patients following the BuFlu regimen and 9 (4.7%) of 190 patients following the BuCy regimen (P = .002). At least one type of grade 3-5 adverse event was reported for 130 (68.1%) of the 191 patients and 147 (77.4%) of the 190 patients in two groups, respectively (P = .041).

Conclusion: The BuFlu regimen has a lower TRM and RRT and similar relapse for patients with AML undergoing haplo-HCT compared with the BuCy regimen.",10/10/2023,JCO.23.00101,{}

Patients and Methods: Adults with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC received 0.27-10 mg/kg Dato-DXd once every 3 weeks during escalation or 4, 6, or 8 mg/kg Dato-DXd once every 3 weeks during expansion. Primary end points were safety and tolerability. Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), survival, and pharmacokinetics.

Results: Two hundred ten patients received Dato-DXd, including 180 in the 4-8 mg/kg dose-expansion cohorts. This population had a median of three prior lines of therapy. The maximum tolerated dose was 8 mg/kg once every 3 weeks; the recommended dose for further development was 6 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. In patients receiving 6 mg/kg (n = 50), median duration on study, including follow-up, and median exposure were 13.3 and 3.5 months, respectively. The most frequent any-grade treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were nausea (64%), stomatitis (60%), and alopecia (42%). Grade ≥3 TEAEs and treatment-related AEs occurred in 54% and 26% of patients, respectively. Interstitial lung disease adjudicated as drug-related (two grade 2 and one grade 4) occurred in three of 50 patients (6%). The ORR was 26% (95% CI, 14.6 to 40.3), and median duration of response was 10.5 months; median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.9 months (95% CI, 2.7 to 8.8 months) and 11.4 months (95% CI, 7.1 to 20.6 months), respectively. Responses occurred regardless of TROP2 expression.

Sandler",MO; PA; VA; GA; TN; CA; MO; TX; Canada; Canada; DE; MO; AZ; TX; NC; CA; MA; CA; PA; CA,"Purpose: To determine whether addition of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to brachytherapy (BT) (COMBO) compared with BT alone would improve 5-year freedom from progression (FFP) in intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

Methods: Men with prostate cancer stage cT1c-T2bN0M0, Gleason Score (GS) 2-6 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 10-20 or GS 7, and PSA < 10 were eligible. The COMBO arm was EBRT (45 Gy in 25 fractions) to prostate and seminal vesicles followed by BT prostate boost (110 Gy if 125-Iodine, 100 Gy if 103-Pd). BT arm was delivered to prostate only (145 Gy if 125-Iodine, 125 Gy if 103-Pd). The primary end point was FFP: PSA failure (American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology [ASTRO] or Phoenix definitions), local failure, distant failure, or death.

Results: Five hundred eighty-eight men were randomly assigned; 579 were eligible: 287 and 292 in COMBO and BT arms, respectively. The median age was 67 years; 89.1% had PSA < 10 ng/mL, 89.1% had GS 7, and 66.7% had T1 disease. There were no differences in FFP. The 5-year FFP-ASTRO was 85.6% (95% CI, 81.4 to 89.7) with COMBO compared with 82.7% (95% CI, 78.3 to 87.1) with BT (odds ratio [OR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.26; Greenwood T P = .18). The 5-year FFP-Phoenix was 88.0% (95% CI, 84.2 to 91.9) with COMBO compared with 85.5% (95% CI, 81.3 to 89.6) with BT (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.30; Greenwood T P = .19). There were no differences in the rates of genitourinary (GU) or GI acute toxicities. The 5-year cumulative incidence for late GU/GI grade 2+ toxicity is 42.8% (95% CI, 37.0 to 48.6) for COMBO compared with 25.8% (95% CI, 20.9 to 31.0) for BT (P < .0001). The 5-year cumulative incidence for late GU/GI grade 3+ toxicity is 8.2% (95% CI, 5.4 to 11.8) compared with 3.8% (95% CI, 2.0 to 6.5; P = .006).

Conclusion: Compared with BT, COMBO did not improve FFP for prostate cancer but caused greater toxicity. BT alone can be considered as a standard treatment for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.",8/20/2023,JCO.22.01856,"{'Jeff M.

Methods: Treatment-naive patients with unresectable stage III-IV melanoma received nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (four doses) followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg (240 mg following a protocol amendment) once every 2 weeks for ≤24 months. The primary end point was the incidence of grade 3-5 select treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Overall survival (OS) was a secondary end point. Outcomes were evaluated in subgroups defined by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), brain metastasis status, and melanoma subtype.

Results: In total, 533 patients received at least one dose of study drug. Grade 3-5 select TRAEs affecting the GI (16%), hepatic (15%), endocrine (11%), skin (7%), renal (2%), and pulmonary (1%) systems occurred in the all-treated population; similar incidence rates were observed across all subgroups. At 21.6 months' median follow-up, 24-month OS rates were 63% in the all-treated population, 44% in the ECOG PS 2 subgroup (including patients with cutaneous melanoma only), 71% in the brain metastasis subgroup, 36% in the ocular/uveal melanoma subgroup, and 38% in the mucosal melanoma subgroup.

Conclusion: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab followed by nivolumab monotherapy was tolerable in patients with advanced melanoma and poor prognostic characteristics. Efficacy was similar between the all-treated population and patients with brain metastases. Reduced efficacy was observed in patients with ECOG PS 2, ocular/uveal melanoma, and/or mucosal melanoma, highlighting the continued need for novel treatment options for these difficult-to-treat patients.",8/10/2023,JCO.22.02199,"{'Reinhard Dummer': ['Honoraria: Roche, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Amgen, Takeda, Pierre Fabre, Sun Pharma, Sanofi, Catalym, Second Genome, Regeneron, Alligator Bioscience, MaxiVax, touchIME, T3 Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis, Amgen, Takeda, Pierre Fabre, Sun Pharma, Sanofi, Catalym, Second Genome, Alligator Bioscience, touchIME, MaxiVax, Regeneron, Pfizer, T3 Pharmaceuticals', 'Research Funding: Roche (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Merck Sharp & Dohme (Inst), Amgen (Inst)'], 'Pippa Corrie': ['Honoraria: Novartis, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Pierre Fabre, Bristol Myers Squibb', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Pierre Fabre, Microbiotica', ""Speakers' Bureau: Merck Sharp & Dohme, Pierre Fabre"", 'Research Funding: Merck Sharp & Dohme (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb (Inst), Novartis (Inst), Iovance Biotherapeutics (Inst), Pfizer (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst)'], 'Ralf Gutzmer': ['Honoraria: Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Roche/Genentech, Novartis, Merck Serono, Almirall Hermal GmbH, Amgen, Sun Pharma, Pierre Fabre, Sanofi/Regeneron, Immunocore', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Roche/Genentech, Novartis, Almirall Hermal GmbH, 4SC, Amgen, Pierre Fabre, Merck Serono, Sun Pharma, Sanofi, Immunocore', 'Research Funding: Novartis (Inst), Amgen (Inst), Merck Serono (Inst), Sun Pharma (Inst), Sanofi (Inst), Kyowa Kirin (Inst), Almirall Hermal GmbH (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Bristol Myers Squibb, Pierre Fabre, Sun Pharma, Boehringer Ingelheim'], 'Tarek M.

This multicenter trial presents the second-part long-term efficacy and safety results of eltrombopag in patients with low-risk MDS and severe thrombocytopenia.

Methods: In this single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase-II trial of adult patients with International Prognostic Scoring System low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS, patients with a stable platelet (PLT) count (<30 × 103/mm3) received eltrombopag or placebo until disease progression. Primary end points were duration of PLT response (PLT-R; calculated from the time of PLT-R to date of loss of PLT-R, defined as bleeding/PLT count <30 × 103/mm3 or last date in observation) and long-term safety and tolerability. Secondary end points included incidence and severity of bleeding, PLT transfusions, quality of life, leukemia-free survival, progression-free survival, overall survival and pharmacokinetics.

Results: From 2011 to 2021, of 325 patients screened, 169 patients were randomly assigned oral eltrombopag (N = 112) or placebo (N = 57) at a starting dose of 50 mg once daily to maximum of 300 mg. PLT-R, with 25-week follow-up (IQR, 14-68) occurred in 47/111 (42.3%) eltrombopag patients versus 6/54 (11.1%) in placebo (odds ratio, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.3 to 14.9; P < .001). In eltrombopag patients, 12/47 (25.5%) lost the PLT-R, with cumulative thrombocytopenia relapse-free survival at 60 months of 63.6% (95% CI, 46.0 to 81.2). Clinically significant bleeding (WHO bleeding score ≥ 2) occurred less frequently in the eltrombopag arm than in the placebo group (incidence rate ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.75; P = .0002). Although no difference in the frequency of grade 1-2 adverse events (AEs) was observed, a higher proportion of eltrombopag patients experienced grade 3-4 AEs (χ2 = 9.5, P = .002). AML evolution and/or disease progression occurred in 17% (for both) of eltrombopag and placebo patients with no difference in survival times.

Conclusion: Eltrombopag was effective and relatively safe in low-risk MDS with severe thrombocytopenia. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02912208 and EU Clinical Trials Register: EudraCT No. 2010-022890-33.",10/1/2023,JCO.22.02699,{}

The phase III, open-label KEYLYNK-010 study evaluated pembrolizumab plus olaparib versus a next-generation hormonal agent (NHA) for biomarker-unselected, previously treated mCRPC.

Methods: Eligible participants had mCRPC that progressed on or after abiraterone or enzalutamide (but not both) and docetaxel. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to pembrolizumab plus olaparib or NHA (abiraterone or enzalutamide). The dual primary end points were radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) by blinded independent central review per Prostate Cancer Working Group–modified RECIST 1.1 and overall survival (OS). Time to first subsequent therapy (TFST) was a key secondary end point. Safety and objective response rate (ORR) were secondary end points.

Results: Between May 30, 2019, and July 16, 2021, 529 participants were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab plus olaparib and 264 to NHA. At final rPFS analysis, median rPFS was 4.4 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.0) with pembrolizumab plus olaparib and 4.2 months (95% CI, 4.0 to 6.1) with NHA (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.25]; P = .55). At final OS analysis, median OS was 15.8 months (95% CI, 14.6 to 17.0) and 14.6 months (95% CI, 12.6 to 17.3), respectively (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.14]; P = .26). At final TFST analysis, median TFST was 7.2 months (95% CI, 6.7 to 8.1) versus 5.7 months (95% CI, 5.0 to 7.1), respectively (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.71 to 1.03]). ORR was higher with pembrolizumab plus olaparib versus NHA (16.8% v 5.9%). Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 34.6% and 9.0% of participants, respectively.

Conclusion: Pembrolizumab plus olaparib did not significantly improve rPFS or OS versus NHA in participants with biomarker-unselected, heavily pretreated mCRPC. The study was stopped for futility. No new safety signals occurred.",8/1/2023,JCO.23.00233,"{'Emmanuel S.

Johnson,NY; the Netherlands; South Korea; Spain; GA; TX; TN; Italy; FL; Spain; NY; Spain; NC; FL; OH; MA; CA; MO; PA; Italy; NY; CA; CA; Poland; MA,"Purpose: The combination of encorafenib (BRAF inhibitor) plus binimetinib (MEK inhibitor) has demonstrated clinical efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in patients with BRAFV600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of encorafenib plus binimetinib in patients with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Methods: In this ongoing, open-label, single-arm, phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03915951), patients with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC received oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus binimetinib 45 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by independent radiology review (IRR). Secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, time to response, and safety.

Results: At data cutoff, 98 patients (59 treatment-naïve and 39 previously treated) with BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC received encorafenib plus binimetinib. Median duration of treatment was 9.2 months with encorafenib and 8.4 months with binimetinib. ORR by IRR was 75% (95% CI, 62 to 85) in treatment-naïve and 46% (95% CI, 30 to 63) in previously treated patients; median DOR was not estimable (NE; 95% CI, 23.1 to NE) and 16.7 months (95% CI, 7.4 to NE), respectively. DCR after 24 weeks was 64% in treatment-naïve and 41% in previously treated patients. Median PFS was NE (95% CI, 15.7 to NE) in treatment-naïve and 9.3 months (95% CI, 6.2 to NE) in previously treated patients. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were nausea (50%), diarrhea (43%), and fatigue (32%). TRAEs led to dose reductions in 24 (24%) and permanent discontinuation of encorafenib plus binimetinib in 15 (15%) patients. One grade 5 TRAE of intracranial hemorrhage was reported. Interactive visualization of the data presented in this article is available at the PHAROS dashboard (https://clinical-trials.dimensions.ai/pharos/).

Conclusion: For patients with treatment-naïve and previously treated BRAFV600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC, encorafenib plus binimetinib showed a meaningful clinical benefit with a safety profile consistent with that observed in the approved indication in melanoma.",7/20/2023,JCO.23.00774,"{'Gregory J.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is an alternative that may spare patients the morbidity of radiation. Understanding the relative patient experiences with these options is necessary to inform treatment decisions.

Methods: PROSPECT was a multicenter, unblinded, noninferiority, randomized trial of neoadjuvant FOLFOX versus 5FUCRT, which enrolled adults with rectal cancer clinically staged as T2N+, cT3N–, or cT3N+ who were candidates for sphincter-sparing surgery. Neoadjuvant FOLFOX was given in six cycles over 12 weeks, followed by surgery. Neoadjuvant 5FUCRT was delivered in 28 fractions over 5.5 weeks, followed by surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy was suggested but not mandated in both groups. Enrolled patients were asked to provide patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at baseline, during neoadjuvant treatment, and at 12 months after surgery. PROs included 14 symptoms from the National Cancer Institute's Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE). Additional PRO instruments measured bowel, bladder, sexual function, and health-related quality of life (HRQL).

Results: From June 2012 to December 2018, 1,194 patients were randomly assigned, 1,128 initiated treatment, and 940 contributed PRO-CTCAE data (493 FOLFOX; 447 5FUCRT). During neoadjuvant treatment, patients reported significantly lower rates of diarrhea and better overall bowel function with FOLFOX while anxiety, appetite loss, constipation, depression, dysphagia, dyspnea, edema, fatigue, mucositis, nausea, neuropathy, and vomiting were lower with 5FUCRT (all multiplicity adjusted P < .05). At 12 months after surgery, patients randomly assigned to FOLFOX reported significantly lower rates of fatigue and neuropathy and better sexual function versus 5FUCRT (all multiplicity adjusted P < .05). Neither bladder function nor HRQL differed between groups at any time point.

Conclusion: For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer choosing between neoadjuvant FOLFOX and 5FUCRT, the distinctive PRO profiles inform treatment selection and shared decision making.",7/20/2023,JCO.23.00903,{}

Loh,NY; NJ; CA; CA; TN; NJ; MD; NY; AL; OH; Germany; MD; TX; MN; CO; Canada; PA; WA; WA,"Purpose: Blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager immunotherapy, is efficacious in relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL (B-ALL) and has a favorable toxicity profile. One aim of the Children's Oncology Group AALL1331 study was to compare survival of patients with low-risk (LR) first relapse of B-ALL treated with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus blinatumomab.

Patients and Methods: After block 1 reinduction, patients age 1-30 years with LR first relapse of B-ALL were randomly assigned to block 2/block 3/two continuation chemotherapy cycles/maintenance (arm C) or block 2/two cycles of continuation chemotherapy intercalated with three blinatumomab blocks/maintenance (arm D). Patients with CNS leukemia received 18 Gy cranial radiation during maintenance and intensified intrathecal chemotherapy. The primary and secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

Results: The 4-year DFS/OS for the 255 LR patients accrued between December 2014 and September 2019 were 61.2% ± 5.0%/90.4% ± 3.0% for blinatumomab versus 49.5% ± 5.2%/79.6% ± 4.3% for chemotherapy (P = .089/P = .11). For bone marrow (BM) ± extramedullary (EM) (BM ± EM; n = 174) relapses, 4-year DFS/OS were 72.7% ± 5.8%/97.1% ± 2.1% for blinatumomab versus 53.7% ± 6.7%/84.8% ± 4.8% for chemotherapy (P = .015/P = .020). For isolated EM (IEM; n = 81) relapses, 4-year DFS/OS were 36.6% ± 8.2%/76.5% ± 7.5% for blinatumomab versus 38.8% ± 8.0%/68.8% ± 8.6% for chemotherapy (P = .62/P = .53). Blinatumomab was well tolerated and patients had low adverse event rates.

Conclusion: For children, adolescents, and young adults with B-ALL in LR first relapse, there was no statistically significant difference in DFS or OS between the blinatumomab and standard chemotherapy arms overall. However, blinatumomab significantly improved DFS and OS for the two thirds of patients with BM ± EM relapse, establishing a new standard of care for this population. By contrast, similar outcomes and poor DFS for both arms were observed in the one third of patients with IEM; new treatment approaches are needed for these patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02101853).",9/1/2023,JCO.22.02200,"{'Patrick A.

A phase II study of afatinib in EGFR mutation–positive lung adenocarcinoma demonstrated high response rates and progression-free survival (PFS).

Patients and Methods: In this phase III study, eligible patients with stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma were screened for EGFR mutations. Mutation-positive patients were stratified by mutation type (exon 19 deletion, L858R, or other) and race (Asian or non-Asian) before two-to-one random assignment to 40 mg afatinib per day or up to six cycles of cisplatin plus pemetrexed chemotherapy at standard doses every 21 days. The primary end point was PFS by independent review. Secondary end points included tumor response, overall survival, adverse events, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs).

Results: A total of 1,269 patients were screened, and 345 were randomly assigned to treatment. Median PFS was 11.1 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.78; P = .001). Median PFS among those with exon 19 deletions and L858R EGFR mutations (n = 308) was 13.6 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherapy (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.65; P = .001). The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea, rash/acne, and stomatitis for afatinib and nausea, fatigue, and decreased appetite for chemotherapy. PROs favored afatinib, with better control of cough, dyspnea, and pain.

Conclusion: Afatinib is associated with prolongation of PFS when compared with standard doublet chemotherapy in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutations.",6/1/2023,JCO.22.02547,{}
Impact of 18F-Labeled Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography Versus Conventional Staging in Patients With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer,Ian S.

If staging does not detect metastases, treatment consists of curative intent combined modality therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, and regional radiation). Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) may detect more asymptomatic distant metastases, but the evidence is based on uncontrolled studies.

Methods: For inclusion, patients had histological evidence of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and TNM stage III or IIb (T3N0, but not T2N1). Consenting patients from six regional cancer centers in Ontario were randomly assigned to 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT or conventional staging (bone scan, CT of the chest/abdomen and pelvis). The primary end point was upstaging to stage IV. A key secondary outcome was receiving curative intent combined modality therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02751710).

Results: Between December 2016 and April 2022, 184 patients were randomly assigned to whole-body PET-CT and 185 patients to conventional staging. Forty-three (23%) PET-CT patients were upstaged to stage IV compared with 21 (11%) conventional staged patients (absolute difference, 12.3% [95% CI, 3.9 to 19.9]; P = .002). Consequently, treatment was changed in 35 (81.3%) of 43 upstaged PET-CT patients and 20 (95.2%) of the 21 upstaged conventional patients. Subsequently, 149 (81%) patients in the PET-CT group received combined modality treatment versus 165 (89.2%) patients in the conventional staging group (absolute difference, 8.2% [95% CI, 0.1 to 15.4]; P = .03).

Conclusion: In patients with LABC, PET-CT detected more distant metastases than conventional staging, and fewer PET-CT patients received combined modality therapy. Our randomized trial demonstrates the utility of the PET-CT staging strategy.",8/10/2023,JCO.23.00249,"{'Ian S.

Previous studies in these patients have shown improvements in various microbiome indices after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). However, whether microbiome improvements translate into improved clinical outcomes remains unclear. We examined this question in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial.

Methods: Two independent cohorts of allogeneic HCT recipients and patients with AML receiving induction chemotherapy were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive standardized oral encapsulated FMT versus placebo upon neutrophil recovery. After each course of antibacterial antibiotics, patients received a study treatment. Up to three treatments were administered within 3 months. The primary end point was 4-month all-cause infection rate. Patients were followed for 9 months.

Results: In the HCT cohort (74 patients), 4-month infection density was 0.74 and 0.91 events per 100 patient-days in FMT and placebo arms, respectively (infection rate ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.42; P = .49). In the AML cohort (26 patients), 4-month infection density was 0.93 in the FMT arm and 1.25 in the placebo arm, with an infection rate ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.32 to 1.71; P = .48). Unique donor bacterial sequences comprised 25%-30% of the fecal microbiota after FMT. FMT improved postantibiotic recovery of microbiota diversity, restored several depleted obligate anaerobic commensals, and reduced the abundance of expanded genera Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Veillonella, and Dialister.

Conclusion: In allogeneic HCT recipients and patients with AML, third-party FMT was safe and ameliorated intestinal dysbiosis, but did not decrease infections. Novel findings from this trial will inform future development of FMT trials.",12/1/2023,JCO.22.02366,{}

Although preclinical and clinical data demonstrate a benefit in changing ET and continuing a CDK4/6i at progression, no randomized prospective trials have evaluated this approach.

Methods: In this investigator-initiated, phase II, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients with HR+/HER2– MBC whose cancer progressed during ET and CDK4/6i, participants switched ET (fulvestrant or exemestane) from ET used pre-random assignment and randomly assigned 1:1 to the CDK4/6i ribociclib versus placebo. PFS was the primary end point, defined as time from random assignment to disease progression or death. Assuming a median PFS of 3.8 months with placebo, we had 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (corresponding to a median PFS of at least 6.5 months with ribociclib) with 120 patients randomly assigned using a one-sided log-rank test and significance level set at 2.5%.

Results: Of the 119 randomly assigned participants, 103 (86.5%) previously received palbociclib and 14 participants received ribociclib (11.7%). There was a statistically significant PFS improvement for patients randomly assigned to switched ET plus ribociclib (median, 5.29 months; 95% CI, 3.02 to 8.12 months) versus switched ET plus placebo (median, 2.76 months; 95% CI, 2.66 to 3.25 months) HR, 0.57 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.85); P = .006. At 6 and 12 months, the PFS rate was 41.2% and 24.6% with ribociclib, respectively, compared with 23.9% and 7.4% with placebo.

Conclusion: In this randomized trial, there was a significant PFS benefit for patients with HR+/HER2– MBC who switched ET and received ribociclib compared with placebo after previous CDK4/6i and different ET.",8/20/2023,JCO.22.02392,{}
Prospective Randomized Trial of Docetaxel Versus Best Supportive Care in Patients With Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With Platinum-Based Chemotherapy,Frances A.

Secondary end points included assessment of response (docetaxel arm only), toxicity, and quality of life.

Results: One hundred four patients (103 of whom were eligible for entry onto the study) were well balanced for prognostic factors. Of 84 patients with measurable lesions, six (7.1%) achieved partial responses (three patients at each dose level). Time to progression was longer for docetaxel patients than for best supportive care patients (10.6 v 6.7 weeks, respectively; P < .001), as was median survival (7.0 v 4.6 months; log-rank test, P = .047). The difference was more significant for docetaxel 75 mg/m2 patients, compared with corresponding best supportive care patients (7.5 v 4.6 months; log-rank test, P = .010; 1-year survival, 37% v 11%; χ2 test, P = .003). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 11 patients treated with docetaxel 100 mg/m2, three of whom died, and in one patient treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m2. Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, with the exception of diarrhea, occurred at a similar rate in both the docetaxel and best supportive care groups.

Conclusion: Treatment with docetaxel is associated with significant prolongation of survival, and at a dose of 75 mg/m2, the benefits of docetaxel therapy outweigh the risks.",5/20/2023,JCO.22.02545,{}

Patients and Methods: Eligible patients had a performance status 0 to 2, previous treatment with one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced NSCLC, and adequate organ function. Patients received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1 with vitamin B12, folic acid, and dexamethasone or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV day 1 with dexamethasone every 21 days. The primary end point was overall survival.

Results: Five hundred seventy-one patients were randomly assigned. Overall response rates were 9.1% and 8.8% (analysis of variance P = .105) for pemetrexed and docetaxel, respectively. Median progression-free survival was 2.9 months for each arm, and median survival time was 8.3 versus 7.9 months (P = not significant) for pemetrexed and docetaxel, respectively. The 1-year survival rate for each arm was 29.7%. Patients receiving docetaxel were more likely to have grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (40.2% v 5.3%; P < .001), febrile neutropenia (12.7% v 1.9%; P < .001), neutropenia with infections (3.3% v 0.0%; P = .004), hospitalizations for neutropenic fever (13.4% v 1.5%; P < .001), hospitalizations due to other drug related adverse events (10.5% v 6.4%; P = .092), use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support (19.2% v 2.6%, P < .001) and all grade alopecia (37.7% v 6.4%; P < .001) compared with patients receiving pemetrexed.

Conclusion: Treatment with pemetrexed resulted in clinically equivalent efficacy outcomes, but with significantly fewer side effects compared with docetaxel in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC and should be considered a standard treatment option for second-line NSCLC when available.",5/20/2023,JCO.22.02546,{}

Phase II studies of pemetrexed plus platinum compounds have also shown activity in this setting.

Patients and Methods: This noninferiority, phase III, randomized study compared the overall survival between treatment arms using a fixed margin method (hazard ratio [HR] < 1.176) in 1,725 chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. Patients received cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 and gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 (n = 863) or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 on day 1 (n = 862) every 3 weeks for up to six cycles.

Results: Overall survival for cisplatin/pemetrexed was noninferior to cisplatin/gemcitabine (median survival, 10.3 v 10.3 months, respectively; HR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.05). Overall survival was statistically superior for cisplatin/pemetrexed versus cisplatin/gemcitabine in patients with adenocarcinoma (n = 847; 12.6 v 10.9 months, respectively) and large-cell carcinoma histology (n = 153; 10.4 v 6.7 months, respectively). In contrast, in patients with squamous cell histology, there was a significant improvement in survival with cisplatin/gemcitabine versus cisplatin/pemetrexed (n = 473; 10.8 v 9.4 months, respectively). For cisplatin/pemetrexed, rates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia (P ≤ .001); febrile neutropenia (P = .002); and alopecia (P < .001) were significantly lower, whereas grade 3 or 4 nausea (P = .004) was more common.

Conclusion: In advanced NSCLC, cisplatin/pemetrexed provides similar efficacy with better tolerability and more convenient administration than cisplatin/gemcitabine.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed using flow cytometry (FCM), and the impact of early intensification and methotrexate (MTX) dose on survival was evaluated.

Patients and Methods: We included 6,187 patients younger than 19 years. MRD by FCM refined the risk group definition previously used in the ALL intercontinental-BFM 2002 study on the basis of age, WBC count, unfavorable genetic aberrations, and treatment response measured morphologically. Patients at intermediate risk (IR) and high risk (HR) were randomly assigned to protocol augmented protocol I phase B (IB) versus IB regimen. MTX doses of 2 versus 5 g/m2 every 2 weeks, four times, were evaluated in precursor B-cell-ALL (pcB-ALL) IR.

Results: The 5-year event-free survival (EFS ± SE) and overall survival (OS ± SE) rates were 75.2% ± 0.6% and 82.6% ± 0.5%, respectively. Their values in risk groups were standard risk (n = 624), 90.7% ± 1.4% and 94.7% ± 1.1%; IR (n = 4,111), 77.9% ± 0.7% and 85.7% ± 0.6%; and HR (n = 1,452), 60.8% ± 1.5% and 68.4% ± 1.4%, respectively. MRD by FCM was available in 82.6% of cases.

Patients and Methods: In a phase II trial, 99 patients were randomly assigned to bevacizumab 7.5 (n = 32) or 15 mg/kg (n = 35) plus carboplatin (area under the curve = 6) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2) every 3 weeks or carboplatin and paclitaxel alone (n = 32). Primary efficacy end points were time to disease progression and best confirmed response rate. On disease progression, patients in the control arm had the option to receive single-agent bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

Results: Compared with the control arm, treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) resulted in a higher response rate (31.5% v 18.8%), longer median time to progression (7.4 v 4.2 months) and a modest increase in survival (17.7 v 14.9 months). Of the 19 control patients that crossed over to single-agent bevacizumab, five experienced stable disease, and 1-year survival was 47%. Bleeding was the most prominent adverse event and was manifested in two distinct clinical patterns; minor mucocutaneous hemorrhage and major hemoptysis. Major hemoptysis was associated with squamous cell histology, tumor necrosis and cavitation, and disease location close to major blood vessels.

Conclusion: Bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel improved overall response and time to progression in patients with advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients with nonsquamous cell histology appear to be a subpopulation with improved outcome and acceptable safety risks.",5/1/2023,JCO.22.02543,{}
Phase II Randomized Trial of Lenalidomide in Children With Pilocytic Astrocytomas and Optic Pathway Gliomas: A Report From the Children's Oncology Group,Katherine E.  Warren; Gilbert  Vezina; Mark  Krailo; Linda  Springer; Allen  Buxton; Cody J.  Peer; William D.  Figg; Chris  William-Hughes; Sandy  Kessel; Maryam  Fouladi; Amar  Gajjar; Daniel  Bowers,MA; DC; CA; CA; CA; MD; MD; CA; RI; OH; TN; TX,"Purpose: Children with low-grade glioma often require long-term therapy and suffer from treatment morbidity. Although targeted agents are promising, tumor targets often encompass normal developmental pathways and long-term effects of inhibition are unknown. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with wide-ranging properties. Phase I studies indicated greater tolerability of lenalidomide in children compared with adults and a potential dose-response effect.

Patients and Methods: We performed a phase II trial of lenalidomide in children with pilocytic astrocytomas and optic pathway gliomas who failed initial therapy. Primary objectives included determination of objective response rate of children randomly assigned to regimen A, low-dose (20 mg/m2/dose), or regimen B, high-dose (115 mg/m2/dose) lenalidomide, and assessment for early progression. Secondary objectives included estimation of event-free survival, overall survival, incidence of toxic events, and assessment of plasma lenalidomide concentrations. Lenalidomide was administered once daily × 21 days of each 28-day cycle for each regimen.

Results: Seventy-four eligible patients were enrolled (n = 37, each arm). The predefined activity level of interest was achieved for both arms. Four objective responses were observed in each arm, and the number of early progressors was low. Eighteen patients completed 26 cycles of therapy (regimen A, n = 12; regimen B, n = 6). The median number of cycles was 14 (range, 2-26) for regimen A and 11 for regimen B (range, 1-26). Of 74 eligible patients who received study drug, 30 required dose reduction for toxicity (regimen A, n = 6; regimen B, n = 24) and 16 discontinued because of toxicity (regimen A, n = 2; regimen B, n = 14).

Conclusion: Lenalidomide demonstrates a sufficient level of activity in children with low-grade glioma to warrant further exploration. Low-dose (20 mg/m2/dose administered once daily × 21 days of each 28-day cycle) lenalidomide appears to have better tolerability with comparable activity.",6/20/2023,JCO.22.01777,{}

In high-risk PV, ruxolitinib controls blood counts and improves symptoms.

Patients and Methods: MAJIC-PV is a randomized phase II trial of ruxolitinib versus best available therapy (BAT) in patients resistant/intolerant to hydroxycarbamide (HC-INT/RES). Primary outcome was complete response (CR) within 1 year. Secondary outcomes included duration of response, event-free survival (EFS), symptom, and molecular response.

Results: One hundred eighty patients were randomly assigned. CR was achieved in 40 (43%) patients on ruxolitinib versus 23 (26%) on BAT (odds ratio, 2.12; 90% CI, 1.25 to 3.60; P = .02). Duration of CR was superior for ruxolitinib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.61; P < .001). Symptom responses were better with ruxolitinib and durable. EFS (major thrombosis, hemorrhage, transformation, and death) was superior for patients attaining CR within 1 year (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.78; P = .01); and those on ruxolitinib (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.94; P = .03). Serial analysis of JAK2V617F variant allele fraction revealed molecular response was more frequent with ruxolitinib and was associated with improved outcomes (progression-free survival [PFS] P = .001, EFS P = .001, overall survival P = .01) and clearance of JAK2V617F stem/progenitor cells. ASXL1 mutations predicted for adverse EFS (HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.47 to 6.17; P = .003). The safety profile of ruxolitinib was as previously reported.

Conclusion: The MAJIC-PV study demonstrates ruxolitinib treatment benefits HC-INT/RES PV patients with superior CR, and EFS as well as molecular response; importantly also demonstrating for the first time, to our knowledge, that molecular response is linked to EFS, PFS, and OS.",7/1/2023,JCO.22.01935,"{'Claire N.

Methods: Patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer were randomly assigned to dose-escalated RT alone (arm 1) or RT plus TAS (arm 2) consisting of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist/antagonist with oral antiandrogen for 6 months. The primary PRO was the validated Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-50). Secondary PROs included Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-fatigue and EuroQOL five-dimensions scale questionnaire (EQ-5D). PRO change scores, calculated for each patient as the follow-up score minus baseline score (at the end of RT and at 6, 12, and 60 months), were compared between treatment arms using a two-sample t test. An effect size of 0.50 standard deviation was considered clinically meaningful.

Results: For the primary PRO instrument (EPIC), the completion rates were ≥86% through the first year of follow-up and 70%-75% at 5 years. For the EPIC hormonal and sexual domains, there were clinically meaningful (P < .0001) deficits in the RT + TAS arm. However, there were no clinically meaningful differences by 1 year between arms. There were also no clinically meaningful differences at any time points between arms for PROMIS-fatigue, EQ-5D, and EPIC bowel/urinary scores.

Conclusion: Compared with dose-escalated RT alone, adding TAS demonstrated clinically meaningful declines only in EPIC hormonal and sexual domains. However, even these PRO differences were transient, and there were no clinically meaningful differences between arms by 1 year.",6/10/2023,JCO.22.02389,{}

We investigated the effects of extending this treatment to 10 years on disease-free survival (DFS).

Patients and Methods: This prospective, randomized, multicenter open-label phase III study assessed the effect of extending anastrozole treatment for an additional 5 years in postmenopausal patients who were disease-free after treatment with either 5 years of anastrozole alone or 2-3 years of tamoxifen followed by 2-3 years of anastrozole. Patients were allocated randomly (1:1) to continue anastrozole for an additional 5 years or stop anastrozole. The primary end point was DFS, including breast cancer recurrence, second primary cancers, and death from any cause. This study is registered with University Hospital Medical Information Network, Japan (UMIN) clinical trials registry (UMIN000000818).

Results: We enrolled 1,697 patients from 117 facilities between November 2007 and November 2012. Follow-up information was available for 1,593 patients (n = 787 in the continue group, n = 806 in the stop group), who were defined as the full analysis set, including 144 patients previously treated with tamoxifen and 259 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery without irradiation. The 5-year DFS rates were 91% (95% CI, 89 to 93) in the continue group and 86% (95% CI, 83 to 88) in the stop group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.82; P < .0010). Notably, extended anastrozole treatment reduced the incidence of local recurrence (continue group, n = 10; stop group, n = 27) and second primary cancers (continue group, n = 27; stop group, n = 52). There was no significant difference in overall or distant DFS. Menopausal or bone-related all-grade adverse events were more frequent among patients in the continue group than those in the stop group, but the incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events was <1% in both groups.

Conclusion: Continuing adjuvant anastrozole for an additional 5 years after 5 years of initial treatment with anastrozole or tamoxifen followed by anastrozole was well tolerated and improved DFS. Although no difference in overall survival was observed as in other trials, extended anastrozole therapy could be one treatment choice in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer.",6/20/2023,JCO.22.00577,"{'Shigehira Saji': ['Honoraria: Chugai Pharma, Eisai, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Novartis, Pfizer, Kyowa Kirin, Daiichi Sankyo, AstraZeneca, Lilly, MSD, Ono Pharmaceutical, Takeda, Exact Sciences', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Kyowa Kirin, Chugai Pharma, Roche/Genentech, Daiichi Sankyo/UCB Japan, MSD', 'Research Funding: Chugai Pharma (Inst), Taiho Pharmaceutical (Inst), Daiichi Sankyo/UCB Japan (Inst), MSD (Inst), AstraZeneca (Inst), Sanofi (Inst)'], 'Shoichiro Ohtani': ['Honoraria: Chugai Pharma, Pfizer, Eisai, Lilly'], 'Yasuo Hozumi': ['Honoraria: AstraZeneca, Chugai Pharma, Pfizer, Lilly'], 'Hiroyuki Takei': [""Speakers' Bureau: Pfizer, Lilly Japan, Kyowa Kirin International, Chugai Pharma, Eisai"", 'Research Funding: Chugai Pharma (Inst), Taiho Pharmaceutical (Inst), Daiichi Sankyo/UCB Japan (Inst), Eisai (Inst), Takeda (Inst)'], 'Toshitaka Nakamura': ['Honoraria: Asahi Pharma'], 'Hirofumi Mukai': ['Honoraria: Daiichi Sankyo, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Takeda']}"

Prolonged rituximab maintenance did not prolong TTNT, whereas it raises concerns about resources use and patient adhesion. Our aim was then to investigate the use of short rituximab maintenance using the subcutaneous (SC) route in patients with low–tumor burden FL.

Methods: Patients with histologically confirmed CD20+ low–tumor burden FL were randomly assigned to receive either rituximab, 375 mg/m2 once daily on D1, D8, D15, and D22, intravenous route (IV, control arm), or rituximab, 375 mg/m2, on day 1 (D1), IV followed by rituximab 1,400 mg total dose, SC once daily on D8, D15, and D22, with maintenance at months 3 (M3), M5, M7, and M9 (experimental arm). The primary end point was PFS. Secondary end points included safety, overall response rates, TTNT, and overall survival (OS).

Results: Two hundred two patients with low–tumor burden FL were randomly assigned to the experimental (n = 100) or control arm (n = 102). The primary end point was met: the 4-year PFS was 58.1% (95% CI, 47.5 to 67.4) and 41.2% (95% CI, 30.6 to 51.6) in experimental and control arms, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.585 [0.393 to 0.871]; P = .0076). Complete response (CR) rates were 59.0% (95% CI, 48.7 to 68.7) in the experimental arm and 36.3% (95% CI, 27.0 to 46.4) in the control arm (P = .001). TTNT and OS were not significantly different. CR was associated with longer PFS and TTNT. High rituximab exposure during the first three months was independently associated with higher CR, PFS, and TTNT.

Conclusion: SC rituximab improves PFS for patients with low–tumor burden FL when used in induction followed by short maintenance. High rituximab exposure during the first 3 months after treatment initiation is, however, the only parameter influencing patient outcomes.",7/1/2023,JCO.22.02327,"{'Guillaume Cartron': ['Honoraria: Gilead Sciences, Janssen, Roche, AbbVie, Novartis, BMS', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, MAbQi, MedXCell, BMS', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche, Gilead Sciences'], 'Emmanuel Bachy': ['Honoraria: Gilead Sciences, Roche, Amgen, Janssen-Cilag, Novartis, Takeda, Incyte', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Gilead Sciences, Incyte, Takeda, Novartis', 'Research Funding: Amgen Foundation (Inst), Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen-Cilag, Roche, Gilead Sciences, Incyte'], 'Hervé Tilly': ['Honoraria: Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Incyte, Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb, ADC Therapeutics', 'Research Funding: Roche/Genentech (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen, Gilead Sciences'], 'Aline Clavert': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: AbbVie, Janssen Oncology, AstraZeneca/MedImmune'], 'Gandhi Laurent Damaj': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Takeda, Amgen, Blueprint Medicines, Novartis, BMS', ""Speakers' Bureau: AbbVie"", 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer, AbbVie, Takeda'], 'Olivier Casasnovas': ['Honoraria: Roche/Genentech, Takeda, Gilead Sciences, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, AbbVie, Celgene, Janssen, Amgen', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche/Genentech, Takeda, Gilead Sciences, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, AbbVie, Celgene, Janssen, Incyte, ADC Therapeutics', 'Research Funding: Roche/Genentech (Inst), Gilead Sciences (Inst), Takeda (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche/Genentech, Takeda, Gilead Sciences, Janssen, AbbVie'], 'Roch Houot': ['Honoraria: MSD, Kite/Gilead, Roche, Novartis, Janssen, Incyte, Takeda', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Kite/Gilead, Novartis, Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene, ADC Therapeutics, Incyte, Miltenyi Biomedicine'], 'Kamal Bouabdallah': ['Honoraria: Roche, Takeda Science Foundation, AbbVie, Kite/Gilead, Sandoz-Novartis, BeiGene', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche, Takeda, Kite/Gilead', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Roche, Takeda, Kite/Gilead'], 'David Sibon': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Takeda, Janssen, Roche, AbbVie', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Takeda, Janssen'], 'Charles Herbaux': ['Honoraria: Roche, Janssen-Cilag, AbbVie, Gilead Sciences', 'Research Funding: Takeda (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Janssen-Cilag, AbbVie, Roche'], 'Thomas Gastinne': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Kite, a Gilead company, Takeda, BMS, Novartis', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Takeda, Kite, a Gilead Company'], 'Luc-Matthieu Fornecker': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Takeda, Roche', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Takeda, Roche'], 'Corinne Haioun': ['Honoraria: Roche, Janssen-Cilag, Gilead Sciences, Miltenyi Biotec, Amgen, Takeda, Celgene'], 'Remy Gressin': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Celgene', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Pfizer, Sandoz, Celgene'], 'Franck Morschhauser': ['Honoraria: Roche/Genentech, Chugai/Roche, Eisai', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Roche/Genentech, Gilead Sciences, Bristol Myers Squibb, AbbVie, Epizyme, Servier, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Genmab'], 'David Ternant': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: Novartis, Boehringer Ingelheim France, Lundbeck', ""Speakers' Bureau: AstraZeneca, Amgen""], 'Luc Xerri': ['Consulting or Advisory Role: EUSA Pharma'], 'Karin Tarte': ['Honoraria: Bristol Myers Squibb', 'Research Funding: Bristol Myers Squibb/Celgene (Inst), Roche (Inst), Epizyme (Inst)', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: Kite/Gilead, Roche']}"
Phase III Study of Pemetrexed in Combination With Cisplatin Versus Cisplatin Alone in Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma,Nicholas J. Vogelzang; James J. Rusthoven; James Symanowski; Claude Denham; E. Kaukel; Pierre Ruffie; Ulrich Gatzemeier; Michael Boyer; Salih Emri; Christian Manegold; Clet Niyikiza; Paolo Paoletti,Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.; Turkey.,"Purpose: Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, a rapidly progressing malignancy with a median survival time of 6 to 9 months, have previously responded poorly to chemotherapy. We conducted a phase III trial to determine whether treatment with pemetrexed and cisplatin results in survival time superior to that achieved with cisplatin alone.

Patients and Methods: Chemotherapy-naive patients who were not eligible for curative surgery were randomly assigned to receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1, or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1. Both regimens were given intravenously every 21 days.

Results: A total of 456 patients were assigned: 226 received pemetrexed and cisplatin, 222 received cisplatin alone, and eight never received therapy. Median survival time in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm was 12.1 months versus 9.3 months in the control arm (P = .020, two-sided log-rank test). The hazard ratio for death of patients in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm versus those in the control arm was 0.77. Median time to progression was significantly longer in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm: 5.7 months versus 3.9 months (P = .001). Response rates were 41.3% in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm versus 16.7% in the control arm (P < .0001). After 117 patients had enrolled, folic acid and vitamin B12 were added to reduce toxicity, resulting in a significant reduction in toxicities in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm.

Conclusion: Treatment with pemetrexed plus cisplatin and vitamin supplementation resulted in superior survival time, time to progression, and response rates compared with treatment with cisplatin alone in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Addition of folic acid and vitamin B12 significantly reduced toxicity without adversely affecting survival time.",4/20/2023,JCO.22.02542,{}

Local anesthesia blocks voltage-gated sodium channels and thereby prevents activation of prometastatic pathways. We conducted an open-label, multicenter randomized trial to test the impact of presurgical, peritumoral infiltration of local anesthesia on disease-free survival (DFS).

Methods: Women with early breast cancer planned for upfront surgery without prior neoadjuvant treatment were randomly assigned to receive peritumoral injection of 0.5% lidocaine, 7-10 minutes before surgery (local anesthetics [LA] arm) or surgery without lidocaine (no LA arm). Random assignment was stratified by menopausal status, tumor size, and center. Participants received standard postoperative adjuvant treatment. Primary and secondary end points were DFS and overall survival (OS), respectively.

Results: Excluding eligibility violations, 1,583 of 1,600 randomly assigned patients were included in this analysis (LA, 796; no LA, 804). At a median follow-up of 68 months, there were 255 DFS events (LA, 109; no LA, 146) and 189 deaths (LA, 79; no LA, 110). In LA and no LA arms, 5-year DFS rates were 86.6% and 82.6% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.95; P = .017) and 5-year OS rates were 90.1% and 86.4%, respectively (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.94; P = .019). The impact of LA was similar in subgroups defined by menopausal status, tumor size, nodal metastases, and hormone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. Using competing risk analyses, in LA and no LA arms, 5-year cumulative incidence rates of locoregional recurrence were 3.4% and 4.5% (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.11), and distant recurrence rates were 8.5% and 11.6%, respectively (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.99). There were no adverse events because of lidocaine injection.

Conclusion: Peritumoral injection of lidocaine before breast cancer surgery significantly increases DFS and OS. Altering events at the time of surgery can prevent metastases in early breast cancer (CTRI/2014/11/005228).",6/20/2023,JCO.22.01966,{}

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study evaluated efficacy and safety of pazopanib monotherapy in treatment-naive and cytokine-pretreated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Patients and Methods: Adult patients with measurable, locally advanced, and/or metastatic RCC were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive oral pazopanib or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival, tumor response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), and safety. Radiographic assessments of tumors were independently reviewed.

Results: Of 435 patients enrolled, 233 were treatment naive (54%) and 202 were cytokine pretreated (46%). PFS was significantly prolonged with pazopanib compared with placebo in the overall study population (median, PFS 9.2 v 4.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.62; P < .0001), the treatment-naive subpopulation (median PFS 11.1 v 2.8 months; HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.60; P < .0001), and the cytokine-pretreated subpopulation (median PFS, 7.4 v 4.2 months; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.84; P < .001). The objective response rate was 30% with pazopanib compared with 3% with placebo (P < .001). The median duration of response was longer than 1 year. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, hypertension, hair color changes, nausea, anorexia, and vomiting. There was no evidence of clinically important differences in quality of life for pazopanib versus placebo.

Conclusion: Pazopanib demonstrated significant improvement in PFS and tumor response compared with placebo in treatment-naive and cytokine-pretreated patients with advanced and/or metastatic RCC.",4/10/2023,JCO.22.02622,{}

Final survival analyses and updated results are reported.

Patients and Methods: Seven hundred fifty treatment-naïve patients with metastatic clear cell RCC were randomly assigned to sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily on a 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off dosing schedule or to IFN-α 9 MU subcutaneously thrice weekly. Overall survival was compared by two-sided log-rank and Wilcoxon tests. Progression-free survival, response, and safety end points were assessed with updated follow-up.

Results: Median overall survival was greater in the sunitinib group than in the IFN-α group (26.4 v 21.8 months, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.821; 95% CI, 0.673 to 1.001; P = .051) per the primary analysis of unstratified log-rank test (P = .013 per unstratified Wilcoxon test). By stratified log-rank test, the HR was 0.818 (95% CI, 0.669 to 0.999; P = .049). Within the IFN-α group, 33% of patients received sunitinib, and 32% received other vascular endothelial growth factor–signaling inhibitors after discontinuation from the trial. Median progression-free survival was 11 months for sunitinib compared with 5 months for IFN-α (P < .001). Objective response rate was 47% for sunitinib compared with 12% for IFN-α (P < .001). The most commonly reported sunitinib-related grade 3 adverse events included hypertension (12%), fatigue (11%), diarrhea (9%), and hand-foot syndrome (9%).

Conclusion: Sunitinib demonstrates longer overall survival compared with IFN-α plus improvement in response and progression-free survival in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic RCC. The overall survival highlights an improved prognosis in patients with RCC in the era of targeted therapy.",4/10/2023,JCO.22.02623,{}
Endosonography With or Without Confirmatory Mediastinoscopy for Resectable Lung Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial,Jelle E.  Bousema; Marcel G.W.  Dijkgraaf; Erik H.F.M.  van der Heijden; Ad F.T.M.  Verhagen; Jouke T.  Annema; Frank J.C.  van den Broek; on behalf of the MEDIASTrial study group,the Netherlands; the Netherlands; the Netherlands; the Netherlands; the Netherlands; the Netherlands,"Purpose: Resectable non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a high probability of mediastinal nodal involvement requires mediastinal staging by endosonography and, in the absence of nodal metastases, confirmatory mediastinoscopy according to current guidelines. However, randomized data regarding immediate lung tumor resection after systematic endosonography versus additional confirmatory mediastinoscopy before resection are lacking.

Methods: Patients with (suspected) resectable NSCLC and an indication for mediastinal staging after negative systematic endosonography were randomly assigned to immediate lung tumor resection or confirmatory mediastinoscopy followed by tumor resection. The primary outcome in this noninferiority trial (noninferiority margin of 8% that previously showed to not compromise survival, Pnoninferior < .0250) was the presence of unforeseen N2 disease after tumor resection with lymph node dissection. Secondary outcomes were 30-day major morbidity and mortality.

Results: Between July 17, 2017, and October 5, 2020, 360 patients were randomly assigned, 178 to immediate lung tumor resection (seven dropouts) and 182 to confirmatory mediastinoscopy first (seven dropouts before and six after mediastinoscopy). Mediastinoscopy detected metastases in 8.0% (14/175; 95% CI, 4.8 to 13.0) of patients. Unforeseen N2 rate after immediate resection (8.8%) was noninferior compared with mediastinoscopy first (7.7%) in both intention-to-treat (Δ, 1.03%; UL 95% CIΔ, 7.2%; Pnoninferior = .0144) and per-protocol analyses (Δ, 0.83%; UL 95% CIΔ, 7.3%; Pnoninferior = .0157). Major morbidity and 30-day mortality was 12.9% after immediate resection versus 15.4% after mediastinoscopy first (P = .4940).

Conclusion: On the basis of our chosen noninferiority margin in the rate of unforeseen N2, confirmatory mediastinoscopy after negative systematic endosonography can be omitted in patients with resectable NSCLC and an indication for mediastinal staging.",8/1/2023,JCO.22.01728,"{'Erik H.F.M. van der Heijden': ['Honoraria: Pentax Medical Devices (Inst), Siemens Healthineers (Inst), Janssen Oncology (Inst)', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (Inst), Intuitive Surgical (Inst)', 'Research Funding: AstraZeneca (Inst), Philips Research (Inst), Pentax Medical Devices (Inst), Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (Inst)', 'Patents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: Patents issued, pending and planned in the field of advanced and navigation bronchoscopy (Inst)'], 'Jouke T.

Methods: CMSs were determined in the safety set (ie, patients that received induction) and full analysis set (FAS; ie, randomly assigned patients who received maintenance) and correlated with median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) since the start of induction or maintenance treatment and objective response rates (ORRs). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI were calculated by univariate/multivariate Cox regression analyses.

Results: Of 377 patients of the safety set, 296 (78.5%) had available CMS data: CMS1/2/3/4: 29 (9.8%)/122 (41.2%)/33 (11.2%)/112 (37.8%) and unclassifiable: 17 (5.7%). The CMSs were prognostic biomarkers in terms of PFS (P < .0001), OS (P < .0001), and ORR (P = .02) since the start of induction treatment. In FAS patients (n = 196), with CMS2/4 tumors, the addition of Pmab to FU/FA maintenance therapy was associated with longer PFS (CMS2: HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.95], P = .03; CMS4: HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.38 to 1.03], P = .07) and OS (CMS2: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.52 to 1.52], P = .66; CMS4: HR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.30 to 0.96], P = .04).

Small,NY; NY; MN; MN; MN; MN; AZ; IL; MA; NC; NY; NH; PA; MD; CA; MO; CA; MO; NY; IL; MA; NC; CA,"Purpose: Enzalutamide and abiraterone both target androgen receptor signaling but via different mechanisms. The mechanism of action of one drug may counteract the resistance pathways of the other. We sought to determine whether the addition of abiraterone acetate and prednisone (AAP) to enzalutamide prolongs overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the first-line setting.

Patients and Methods: Men with untreated mCRPC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive first-line enzalutamide with or without AAP. The primary end point was OS. Toxicity, prostate-specific antigen declines, pharmacokinetics, and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) were also examined. Data were analyzed using an intent-to-treat approach. The Kaplan-Meier estimate and the stratified log-rank statistic were used to compare OS between treatments.

Results: In total, 1,311 patients were randomly assigned: 657 to enzalutamide and 654 to enzalutamide plus AAP. OS was not statistically different between the two arms (median, 32.7 [95% CI, 30.5 to 35.4] months for enzalutamide v 34.2 [95% CI, 31.4 to 37.3] months for enzalutamide and AAP; hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; one-sided P = .03; boundary nominal significance level = .02). rPFS was longer in the combination arm (median rPFS, 21.3 [95% CI, 19.4 to 22.9] months for enzalutamide v 24.3 [95% CI, 22.3 to 26.7] months for enzalutamide and AAP; HR, 0.86; two-sided P = .02). However, pharmacokinetic clearance of abiraterone was 2.2- to 2.9-fold higher when administered with enzalutamide, compared with clearance values for abiraterone alone.

Conclusion: The addition of AAP to enzalutamide for first-line treatment of mCRPC was not associated with a statistically significant benefit in OS. Drug-drug interactions between the two agents resulting in increased abiraterone clearance may partly account for this result, although these interactions did not prevent the combination regimen from having more nonhematologic toxicity.",6/20/2023,JCO.22.02394,"{'Michael J.

This phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of sugemalimab, an anti–PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, in R/R ENKTL.

Methods: Eligible patients received sugemalimab 1,200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for up to 24 months or until progression, death, or study withdrawal. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by an independent radiologic review committee. Key secondary end points included ORR assessed by the investigators, complete response rate, duration of response, and safety.

Results: At the data cutoff (February 23, 2022), 80 patients were enrolled and followed for a median of 18.7 months. At baseline, 54 (67.5%) had stage IV disease and 39 (48.8%) had received ≥2 lines of prior systemic therapy. Independent radiologic review committee–assessed ORR was 44.9% (95% CI, 33.6 to 56.6); 28 (35.9%) patients achieved a complete response and seven (9.0%) achieved a partial response, with a 12-month duration of response rate of 82.5% (95% CI, 62.0 to 92.6). Investigator-assessed ORR was 45.6% (95% CI, 34.3 to 57.2), and 24 (30.4%) patients achieved a complete response. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were grade 1-2 in severity, and grade ≥ 3 events were reported in 32 (40.0%) patients.

Conclusion: Sugemalimab showed robust and durable antitumor activity in R/R ENKTL. Treatment was well tolerated with expected safety profile for this drug class.",6/1/2023,JCO.22.02367,"{'Ye Guo': ['Honoraria: Merck Serono, Roche, MSD, BMS', 'Consulting or Advisory Role: Merck Serono, MSD, Bayer, Roche'], 'Qinzhou Qi': ['Employment: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: CStone Pharmaceuticals'], 'Xiaoli Zhu': ['Employment: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: CStone Pharmaceuticals'], 'Dan Zhu': ['Employment: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: CStone Pharmaceuticals'], 'Siyuan Wang': ['Employment: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: CStone Pharmaceuticals'], 'Teng Fang': ['Employment: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: CStone Pharmaceuticals'], 'Hangjun Dai': ['Employment: Cstone Pharmaceuticals', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: CStone Pharmaceuticals'], 'Qingmei Shi': ['Employment: Cstone Pharmaceuticals', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: CStone Pharmaceuticals'], 'Jason Yang': ['Employment: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Leadership: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Stock and Other Ownership Interests: CStone Pharmaceuticals', 'Travel, Accommodations, Expenses: CStone Pharmaceuticals']}"

Patients and Methods: Women (1,523) enrolled onto National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-18 were randomly assigned to preoperative or postoperative AC therapy. Clinical tumor response to preoperative therapy was graded as complete (cCR), partial (cPR), or no response (cNR). Tumors with a cCR were further categorized as either pathologic complete response (pCR) or invasive cells (pINV). Disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and survival were estimated through 5 years and compared between treatment groups. In the preoperative arm, proportional-hazards models were used to investigate the relationship between outcome and tumor response.

Results: There was no significant difference in DFS, DDFS, or survival (P = .99, .70, and .83, respectively) among patients in either group. More patients treated preoperatively than postoperatively underwent lumpectomy and radiation therapy (67.8% v 59.8%, respectively). Rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after lumpectomy were similar in both groups (7.9% and 5.8%, respectively; P = .23). Outcome was better in women whose tumors showed a pCR than in those with a pINV, cPR, or cNR (relapse-free survival [RFS] rates, 85.7%, 76.9%, 68.1%, and 63.9%, respectively; P < .0001), even when baseline prognostic variables were controlled. When prognostic models were compared for each treatment group, the preoperative model, which included breast tumor response as a variable, discriminated outcome among patients to about the same degree as the postoperative model.

Conclusion: Preoperative chemotherapy is as effective as postoperative chemotherapy, permits more lumpectomies, is appropriate for the treatment of certain patients with stages I and II disease, and can be used to study breast cancer biology. Tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy correlates with outcome and could be a surrogate for evaluating the effect of chemotherapy on micrometastases; however, knowledge of such a response provided little prognostic information beyond that which resulted from postoperative therapy.",4/1/2023,JCO.22.02571,{}
"Randomized Phase II Trial of Ficlatuzumab With or Without Cetuximab in Pan-Refractory, Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer",Julie E.  Bauman; Nabil F.  Saba; Denise  Roe; Jessica R.

Chung,DC; AZ; GA; AZ; AZ; PA; SC; CT; FL; AZ; AZ; AZ; AZ; GA; PA; CT; AZ; AZ; AZ; AZ; AZ; FL,"Purpose: Primary or acquired resistance to cetuximab, an antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody (mAb), minimizes its utility in recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Aberrant hepatocyte growth factor/cMet pathway activation is an established resistance mechanism. Dual pathway targeting may overcome resistance.

Patients and Methods: This multicenter, randomized, noncomparative phase II study evaluated ficlatuzumab, an antihepatocyte growth factor mAb, with or without cetuximab in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. The primary end point was median progression-free survival (PFS); an arm met significance criteria if the lower bound of the 90% CI excluded the historical control of 2 months. Key eligibility criteria were HNSCC with known human papillomavirus (HPV) status, cetuximab resistance (progression within 6 months of exposure in the definitive or recurrent/metastatic setting), and resistance to platinum and anti–PD-1 mAb. Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR), toxicity, and the association of HPV status and cMet overexpression with efficacy. Continuous Bayesian futility monitoring was used.

Results: From 2018 to 2020, 60 patients were randomly assigned and 58 were treated. Twenty-seven versus 33 patients were allocated to monotherapy versus combination. Arms were balanced for major prognostic factors. The monotherapy arm closed early for futility. The combination arm met prespecified significance criteria with a median PFS of 3.7 months (lower bound 90% CI, 2.3 months; P = .04); the ORR was 6 of 32 (19%), including two complete and four partial responses. Exploratory analyses were limited to the combination arm: the median PFS was 2.3 versus 4.1 months (P = .03) and the ORR was 0 of 16 (0%) versus 6 of 16 (38%; P = .02) in the HPV-positive versus HPV-negative subgroups, respectively. cMet overexpression was associated with reduced hazard of progression in HPV-negative but not HPV-positive disease (P interaction = .02).

Conclusion: The ficlatuzumab-cetuximab arm met significance criteria for PFS and warrants phase III development.
